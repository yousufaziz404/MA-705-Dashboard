"Black Bowmore 42 year old 1964 vintage, 40.5%",Single Malt Scotch,97,4500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"What impresses me most is how this whisky evolves; it's incredibly complex. On the nose and palate, this is a thick, viscous, whisky with notes of sticky toffee, earthy oak, fig cake, roasted nuts, fallen fruit, pancake batter, black cherry, ripe peach, dark chocolate-covered espresso bean, polished leather, tobacco, a hint of wild game, and lingering, leafy damp kiln smoke. Flavors continue on the palate long after swallowing. This is what we all hope for (and dream of) in an older whisky!",
"Bowmore 46 year old (distilled 1964), 42.9%",Single Malt Scotch,97,13500,10001 and above,"There have been some legendary Bowmores from the mid-60s and this is every bit their equal. All of them share a remarkable aroma of tropical fruit, which here moves into hallucinatory intensity: guava, mango, peach, pineapple, grapefruit. There’s a very light touch of peat smoke, more a memory of Islay than the reality. Concentrated; even at low strength the palate is silky, heady, and haunting, and lasts forever in the dry glass. A legend is born. (Eight bottles only for the U.S.) Editor's Choice.",
"Johnnie Walker Blue Label, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,97,225,101 to 500 Dollars,"Magnificently powerful and intense. Caramels, dried peats, elegant cigar smoke, seeds scraped from vanilla beans, brand new pencils, peppercorn, coriander seeds, and star anise make for a deeply satisfying nosing experience. Silky caramels, bountiful fruits of ripe peach, stewed apple, orange pith, and pervasive smoke with elements of burnt tobacco. An abiding finish of smoke, dry spices, and banoffee pie sweetness. Close to perfection. Editor's Choice",
"Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1969 vintage, 50.8%",Single Malt Scotch,96,750,501 to 1000 Dollars,"It’s great that Glenlivet releases whiskies under the 'Cellar Collection' label. It really shows the true potential of Glenlivet. This bottling is classic ultra-matured Glenlivet, and rivals the 1959 vintage Cellar Collection as the best one ever. An incredibly complex whisky, with notes of vanilla, ripe barley, coconut, and caramel. All this is accentuated by glazed orange, hazelnut, and a potpourri of dried spices. Not the least bit tired for such an aged whisky. (Only 800 bottles for the U.S.)",
"The Macallan 29 year old 1976 Vintage (Cask #11354), 45.4%",Single Malt Scotch,96,1500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Classic sherry cask-aged Macallan. Antique amber with hints of ruby. Thickly textured, complex, and quite deep, with notes of toffee, ripe pit fruit, raisin, apple pie, dried spice (cinnamon, clove, ginger, and mint), and a wisp of smoke. An exceptional, multi-faceted Macallan!",
"The Dalmore 50 year old, 52.8%",Single Malt Scotch,96,1500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"The Dalmore is one of a handful of whiskies that seem to be able to age in the cask for many decades and still improve. This one is incredibly viscous on the nose and palate (and very heavy on the tongue), with chewy toffee and old pot still rum. The classic Dalmore marmalade note shines throughout, along with vanilla cream, an array of dried spices (especially cinnamon and evergreen), juicy oak, forest bedding, rancio, old armagnac, polished leather, tobacco, maple syrup, dark chocolate, almond macaroon, and subtle espresso. Long, mouth-coating finish. The flavors evolve like waves lapping on the palate -- especially the interplay with the oak. I can’t drink this whisky slowly enough. A rare experience for the lucky few who can afford it. (Price is per 100ml.)",
"Gold Bowmore 1964 vintage, 42.4% ",Single Malt Scotch,96,6250,5001 to 10000 Dollars,"Deep gold color. Surprisingly lively on the nose for its age. A complex array of fruit (tangerine, sultana, pink grapefruit, papaya, and the general overall citrus DNA that you’ll find in old Bowmores), with balancing notes of honey and vanilla. A hint of damp smoke and coconut. Just like with Black Bowmore, this is a texturally soothing whisky on the palate, which continues to evolve in waves -- first the sweet honey, coating vanilla, and lively fruit, then turning quite visceral, with juicy oak, damp earth, deep peat smoke, and charcoal, followed by another wave of fruit (this time, dried fruit), finishing off with subtle charred oak and roasted nuts. This whisky is better than White Bowmore, and it falls just short of Black Bowmore (which I rated 97), because it’s just a bit softer and less vibrant on the palate.",
"Bowmore 40 year old, 44.8%",Single Malt Scotch,96,11000,10001 and above,"Definitely showing its age, but not in a bad way — the distillery character is still there. Solid foundation of thick, chewy toffee, old pot still rum, and fig cake. Fruity too, with notes of golden raisin and nectarine. Soft, seductive peat smoke, juicy oak, cinnamon, and brine round out the palate. Excellent balance! One of the finest Bowmore whiskies I’ve ever tasted (and, at this price, will probably never taste again.) (Editor's Pick) ",
"Compass Box The General, 53.4%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,96,325,101 to 500 Dollars,"With a name inspired by a 1926 Buster Keaton movie, only 1,698 bottles produced, and the news that one of the two batches is more than 30 years old, the clues were there that this blend was never going to be cheap. It isn't, but it's superb, rich in flavor that screams dusty old oak office, fresh polish, and Sunday church, with spices, oak dried fruits, squiggly raisins, and a surprising melting fruit-and-nut dairy chocolate back story.",
"Glenfarclas Family Casks 1954 (Cask #1260), 47.2%",Single Malt Scotch,96,3360,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"A rich amber color and elegantly oxidized notes greet you. There are luscious old fruits—pineapple, dried peach, apricot—and puffs of coal-like smokiness. In time, sweet spices (cumin especially) emerge. Superbly balanced. The palate, while fragile, still has real sweetness alongside a lick of treacle. It can take a drop of water, allowing richer, darker fruits to emerge. The finish is powerful, long, and resonant. Superb, not over-wooded, and a fair price for such a rarity. £1,995",
"Chivas Regal Ultis, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,96,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Captivating, enticing, and wonderfully charming, this first blended malt from Chivas Regal contains selections of five Speyside malts: Strathisla, Longmorn, Tormore, Allt-a-Bhainne, and Braeval. Red apple, cherry, raspberry fudge, peach and mango fruit salad, dusting of cinnamon, and dry heather sprigs. In essence, it’s rich and satisfying, with dark vanilla, apricot, Bourneville-covered Brazil nuts, and tangerine, smoothed over by caramel and wood spices, maltiness, and gingersnap biscuits. Quite heavenly. Editor's Choice",
"Chivas, 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,95,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"An essay in balance on both the aroma and palate. Silky layers of delicate sweetness (honeyed vanilla, caramel, light toffee) permeate through clean, delicate fruit (citrus, peach, currant), and subtle, complex dried spice. Clean finish, with a hint of dark chocolate. A very versatile, very drinkable blend which suits most moods and occasions. Indeed, a benchmark blended scotch. 
",
"Johnnie Walker Blue Anniversary, 60%",Blended Scotch Whisky,95,3500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Formulated to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Johnnie Walker. This is a fabulous whisky for anyone who can spring for the bottle. It is deep, dark, and quite powerful with a hefty malt foundation and sweeter notes of toffee and vanilla combined with resinous oak, complex fruit (both bright citrus notes and darker pit fruits), crisp mint, tobacco, polished leather, and heavy peat smoke. A tour de force of a blended scotch-as big as many single malts reviewed here. 
",s
"Ardbeg 1974 Vintage (Cask #3145), 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,95,20000,10001 and above,"Cask #3145 is the lighter in color, and the sweet notes that balance the smoke and seaweed are not as deeply caramelized as Cask #3542. I’m tasting hints of shortbread and caramel, which show through the peat smoke, tobacco, toasted nuts, firm spice notes (cinnamon, clove, and mint), and lingering brine. Very complex. Price listed includes the entire Double Barrel 1974 Vintage set.",
"Glenfarclas 1968 Vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,95,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"It has been quite a while since we’ve seen a new Glenfarclas here in the U.S. but, after tasting this whisky, it was worth the wait. Glenfarclas is a rich, stylish whisky that ages very well, and this 1968 vintage proves it. It is very deep and mature, with complex fruit (sultana, marmalade) layered by sweetness (honey, caramel, and toffee). All those years in oak contribute another dimension to the whisky, providing a dry, oaky spiciness, polished leather, and a hint of tobacco-especially on the finish. Never does the whisky taste tired or excessively woody. It expresses all that is good about an older whisky, without any of the down side. I’m told that most of the 1,400 bottles imported to the U.S. went to the Chicago area. It’s worth taking the extra time to track down a bottle.",
"Highland Park  1973 vintage 33 year old (Cask #13308), 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,95,280,101 to 500 Dollars,"Dark and decadent. Notes of old pot still rum, roasted nuts, chocolate fudge, burnished leather, Dundee cake, tobacco, and a hint of damp peat. When I drink this, I feel like I’m sitting in the study of a stately Scottish mansion contemplating a fine, aged Cuban cigar. Royalty in a glass. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot)",
"Dun Bheagan (distilled at Springbank) Cask No. 1704 35 year old 1970 vintage, 50.5%",Single Malt Scotch,95,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"Quite fresh and appetizing for a 35 year old whisky, but not too surprising for a Springbank. Notes of creamy vanilla, burnt caramel, coconut custard, brine, and a hint of anise. Complex, vibrant, and well-balanced. Reminds me why I love those old Springers. Devotees will not be disappointed. A stunning whisky! (Exclusive to Astor Wines and Spirits.)",
"The Last Drop, 1960 vintage, 48 year old, 52%",Blended Scotch Whisky,95,2000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"A 12 year old blended whisky was created in 1972 consisting of 70 different malt whiskies and 12 grain whiskies.  The blend was then placed in three sherry casks, where it was matured for the next 36 years (highly irregular, to say the least).  The quality of the sherry casks is quite evident, as is the whisky's age.  There's substantial malt content here, too.  These three factors, along with the wide range of malt and grain whiskies, combine to create one of the finest blended Scotch whiskies I have ever tasted.  It's dark, mysterious, and enormously complex, with notes of molasses, fig cake, dried fruit, tobacco, dark chocolate, old pot still rum, and polished leather, finishing with lingering cinnamon and mint.  There's no sign of this whisky getting tired at all.  I am pleased they bottled it at natural strength and didn't water it down to 40% or 43% abv, which could have ruined it.
(Allocation information:  There's a total of 1.347 bottles, of which only 350 are being imported to the U.S.  They are available exclusively at Binny's Beverage Depot (Chicago), Park Avenue Liquors (New York), and Wally's (Los Angeles)).",
"The Macallan Estate Reserve, 45.7%",Single Malt Scotch,95,215,101 to 500 Dollars,"Amber color. Richly textured (great mouth feel), with vanilla fudge, nougat, ripe citrus, and ginger cake leading to a complex, spicy finish. Great depth on this one. Well-polished. My pick of the lot.",
"Lombard 'Jewels of Scotland' (distilled at Brora), 1982 vintage, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,95,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Bottled in 2004, but just recently put in circulation here in the U.S. (Very strange.) It’s worth the wait. It’s fresh (even at 22 years old), appetizing, spicy, and briny. There’s a sweet foundation of vanilla wafer and caramel, with a slightly oily texture. White pepper, seaweed, mustard seed, lime, gherkin, and teasing gin botanicals add complexity. Spicy, salty finish. A vibrant, dynamic expression of the shuttered original Clynelish distillery. Quite stunning, actually. Find yourself a bottle before they’re gone!",
"Jewels of Scotland (distilled at Springbank) 1965 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,95,400,101 to 500 Dollars,"Bottled in 2001, but still in circulation and (fortunately) just finding its way to me. These Springers from the ‘60s are getting rarer and quite expensive. This is a great example of why they are so coveted -- clean and well matured, with no sign of excessive oak. Elegant sherried fruit dovetails nicely with polished oak and a steady stream of dried spices. Look for citrus, nectarine, red licorice, coconut oil, ripe banana, and vanilla custard with warming cinnamon and brine. Warm, spicy finish. Very polished!",
"Brora, 30 year old (2009 Release), 53.2%",Single Malt Scotch,95,400,101 to 500 Dollars,"This whisky has all the positive aspects of a very mature whisky (depth, complexity) without all the negative ones (excessive oak, one-dimensional). Very clean, but oily in texture, with honeyed vanilla, caramel, citrus (tangerine, orange, lemon), nectarine, olive brine, black pepper, ginger, cut grass, mustard seed, and just the hint of teasing smoke. Briny, spicy finish. Wonderful!",
"Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1973 vintage, 49%",Single Malt Scotch,95,1250,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"A marriage of three casks, one of them an ex-sherry butt. The sherry is certainly evident, and this is more sherried than many of the Cellar Collection whiskies to date. Opulent and seductive, with prominent fruit (glazed spiced oranges, ripe peach, and hints of pineapple and coconut), caramel-coated nuts, and vanilla custard. A peppering of ginger and cinnamon throughout. Coating, soothing finish. Polished and seamless, with no trace of excessive oak. One of the richest -- and finest -- Cellar Collections to date. Anyone willing and able to cough up the bucks for this whisky will be richly rewarded. (Only 240 bottles available in the U.S., beginning June 2010.)",
"Glenfarclas 40 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,95,460,101 to 500 Dollars,"Glenfarclas has a proven track record for aging very well. I’ve enjoyed some amazing 25 and 30 year old expressions, in addition to some older vintage offerings. Does this new 40 year old follow suit? Absolutely! It’s complex and well-rounded, with great depth and no excessive oak. Lush, candied citrus (especially orange), old pot still rum, maple syrup, fig, roasted nuts, and polished leather, with hints of mocha, candied ginger, and tobacco. A bit oily in texture (which I find soothing) with good tannic grip on the finish. A classic, well-matured Glenfarclas — and a very good value for its age. (Editor's Choice)",
"Compass Box Flaming Heart (10th Anniversary bottling), 48.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,95,105,101 to 500 Dollars,"A marriage of three different single malts, aged in American and French oak. This whisky shows the advantage of marrying whiskies from more than one distillery (when properly done). Vibrant, with a complex array of fruit (orchard fruit, sultana), sweetness (light toffee, marzipan, honeyed malt), spice (creamy vanilla, mocha, warming pepper), smoke (tar, smoked olive, coal), and lesser notes of toasted almond and beach pebbles. More smoke and tar on the palate than the nose, yet always in balance. Well played! (Editor's Choice)",
"Glenglassaugh, 40 year old, 44.6%",Single Malt Scotch,95,2525,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"An excellent example of an ultra-mature, sherried whisky done the right way. Much darker and more decadent than the other two releases here. Silky texture. Rummy, jammy fruit, toasted walnut, leather, spice (cinnamon, clove), tobacco, and dark chocolate, with a foundation of juicy oak. Tasting this whisky, you know it’s old, but you also know it’s very good. ",
"Brora 2010, 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,95,455,101 to 500 Dollars,"Though Brora has acquired cult status, it has to be said that for a few years these Special Release Broras went through an off-putting butyric phase, which might well have put off newbies to this legendary closed site, who must have wondered what all the fuss was about.
One nose of the 2010 SR shows that these days have been consigned to the past. This is classy from the word go. Gold in color; the nose manages to be both overtly waxy — I’m reminded of waxed paper — and fragrant. Behind that is coal smoke, rather than the heavy peatiness of earlier vintages (Brora’s peating levels varied in its last years). In other words, this is robust and powerful, with an evocative aroma that speaks of old sea chests, the seashore, and vellum. Hugely concentrated, with massed fruits — quince especially — following behind. This is amplified with a drop or two of water. 
The palate is unctuous and heavy. Tectonic plates move more quickly than this does in the mouth. When it does, the oily/waxy textures and flavors move slowly — camphor, peach, membrillo, hints of citrus, and toward the finish a growing brininess (akin to olives) and a hint of smoke. Elemental and one of the best Broras for years. [not available in the U.S.]£280  ",
"Bowmore 50 year old (distilled 1961), 40.7%",Single Malt Scotch,95,26650,10001 and above,"The whisky is sensational, a glorious mix of ginseng syrup, baked banana, semi-dried tropical fruits, and an exotic smoked edge. Without the last, you could believe it was a delicate Cognac. In time, there’s peppermint and guava syrup. A sip is all you need to reveal perfect, thrilling harmony: light nuttiness, pollen, subtle fruits, gentle smoke, and light fungal touches. It’s stunning, but it’s £16,000! Whisky this great, even in limited quantities, should be fairly priced. Points off. £16,000",
"Brora 35 year old, 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,95,750,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Maturation of this 1978 distillate has taken place in European oak and refill American oak casks. Fresh and fruity on the early, herbal nose; a hint of wax, plus brine, developing walnut fudge, and an underlying wisp of smoke. Finally, wood resin. The palate is very fruity, with mixed spices, then plain chocolate, damp undergrowth, gentle peat smoke, and finally coal. Mildly medicinal. Ashy peat and aniseed linger in the long, slowly drying finish. Brora at its very best. (2,944 bottles) Editor's Choice",
"Compass Box The Peat Monster 10th Anniversary Special Cask Strength Bottling, 54.7%",Blended Scotch Whisky,95,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"As you’d expect, solid peat is the first thing out of the glass, but this isn’t just a peat beast. Underneath are honey, dried fruit, and malt. The palate is all about balance, with honeyed malt, raisin, and oak spice all complementing smoky peat. A lush mouthfeel makes you forget it’s cask strength. A pure love note in a glass from Compass Box to Park Avenue Liquor.  (Park Avenue Liquor only)",
"The Last Drop 50 year old, 50.9%",Blended Scotch Whisky,95,4000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Would you have gambled The Last Drop 1960 liquid in new sherry wood for four more years? The indulgent nose proffers maple syrup, buckwheat honey, roasted spices, blue grapes, pomegranate, raspberry compote, cilantro, pandan leaf, and beefsteak juices soaking into mushroom gills. The complex, lustrous mouthfeel is replete with a sheen of rich maltiness, molasses lashed by sherry before a dry, resinous finish. Water brings an oily nuttiness, then further drops produce a silky, clingy texture. Glorious. Miraculous. Victorious. (388 bottles only)",
"The Balvenie 1973 43 year old, 46.6%",Single Malt Scotch,95,15000,10001 and above,"This expression was matured in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. Overtly sherried, with figs, sultanas, cinnamon, and old warm leather on the nose. Finally, fragrant, with milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. The Turkish delight carries over to the palate, before the chocolate darkens to plain, with raisins, smoked ham, and cloves in the long finish. Remarkably, almost no tannic oak. Textbook stuff.",
"Ardbeg Corryvreckan, 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,95,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"Part of the permanent Ardbeg range since 2008, Corryvreckan is created from a blend of standard Ardbeg and Ardbeg aged in virgin French Limousin oak casks. Smoky bacon and seaweed, plus dark berries, prickly spices, walnuts, lemon, and sweet peat on the nose. Sweet and savory on the palate, with more lively spice, woodsmoke, phenols, and licorice. The finish is lengthy, with peat, sea salt, pepper, and black coffee. Editors’ Choice",
"Royal Salute 28 year old Kew Palace Edition, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,95,790,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Fresh spring floral bouquets, white peach, and nectarine tumble with sweet caramel, dried cherry, white chocolate, fresh linen notes, and vanilla cake batter. Silky smooth with fresh summer fruits, the strong peppery spices push to the fore, but this is nimble, graceful, and displays a real lightness. Compelling, captivating blending for the Flask Collection by Sandy Hyslop, this has a fragrance you could enjoy all night.",
"Highland Park 50 year old, 42.5%",Single Malt Scotch,95,15000,10001 and above,"The nose of this veteran is hugely enticing; rich, with old leather, soft spices, sultanas, figs, polished oak, and dunnage warehouses. Tangy orange develops in time. The orange carries over onto the palate—amazingly vibrant and youthful fruitiness—followed by soft toffee, woodsmoke, and a sprinkling of dusty oak. The finish is extraordinarily long, with licorice and fruit-laden old oak. A true classic! (77 bottles in U.S.)",
"Chivas Regal The Icon, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,95,3500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"A spectacular citrus nose with incredible freshness; neroli oil, bergamot orange, an array of wood spices, baked apricot, dried strawberry, heather, lavender, honeysuckle, jasmine, and hyacinth. An intense array of citrus on the palate—the strongest being mandarin, it is thick-textured yet agile—accompanied by baked brioche, Ling heather honey, vanilla, and oak, with a hint of eucalyptus on the extraordinarily long finish. A masterclass in rare whisky blending.",
"Ardbeg 19 year old Traigh Bhan, 46.2%",Single Malt Scotch,95,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"Ardbeg’s first core bottling with an age statement in nearly 20 years was matured in bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. Rock pools, fabric Band-Aids, coal dust, licorice, hot peat, pineapple, and a seafood platter on the complex nose. The palate is oily, with smoked fish, overt peat smoke, chili, iodine, and lemon. Long in the finish, with more iodine and peppery peat. A delightfully traditional Ardbeg.",
"Ardbeg 19 year old Traigh Bhan (Batch 2), 46.2%",Single Malt Scotch,95,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"The early nose offers hand-rolled tobacco, ginger, black pepper, and fragrant woodsmoke. Medicinal notes, brine, and lemon develop in time. Sweet peat smoke, tropical fruits, toffee, and aniseed on the palate, with smoked haddock and a suggestion of tar. Iodine, black pepper, and sea salt in the lengthy finish.",
"Laphroaig Triple Wood, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,94,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is the first time I’ve been up for reviews here so I had a game plan: play it cool, mark tightly, let everyone know I’m hard to please. Then they gave me this, the whisky equivalent to front row tickets to Neil Young on his current Twisted Road tour: not just a chance to get up close and personal with an old favorite, but to do so with an old favorite who’s on fire. Laphroaig’s owners are intent on ensuring a big peaty engine for any new release, but this is a monster by anyone’s standards. It’s essentially Quarter Cask finished in oloroso sherry casks, so in addition to the intense charcoal smoke attack there are rich fruity notes; blackcurrant and berries. It’s an evening barbecue whisky. Grill that fish until it’s blackened and crispy, drizzle on lemon, and as the smoke rears up in protest, sip this. Big, moody, broody, fruity, and rich: what’s not to love? (Travel Retail and some European specialist retailers)",
"Ardbeg 1974 Vintage (Cask #3524), 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,94,20000,10001 and above,"Cask #3524 is darker, with notes of sticky toffee pudding and chewy caramel that firmly support the polished leather, cigar box, roasted chestnut, smoked seaweed, tar, dark chocolate, and, on the finish, espresso. A meditative whisky. Price listed includes entire Double Barrel 1974 Vintage set.",
"Glenmorangie Astar 2017, 52.5%",Single Malt Scotch,94,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is the 15th Special Releases bottling of Lagavulin 12 year old. Matured in refill American oak hogsheads. The nose is smoky, with kippers, charcuterie, and bonfire embers, offset by berry fruits. On the unctuous palate, smoke blends with vanilla, green apples, and licorice, plus pepper and sea salt. Peppery, ashy peat in the lengthy finish. (Individual reviewer rating: 91)",
"Bruichladdich Legacy 6 34 year old, 41%",Single Malt Scotch,94,550,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The sixth and last bottling from the Legacy series. Legacy 6 is a marriage of six casks from 1965, 1970, and 1972. Soft and mellow on the nose and palate, with unbelievably restrained oak for such a mature whisky. Delicious notes of coconut, soothing vanilla, caramel custard, and banana cream, peppered with spice notes of cinnamon, mint, and teaberry that emerge on a soft finish that fades out gently. A fitting end to the Legacy series. I’m sad to see them go.",
"Bunnahabhain 35 year old 1971 vintage, 44.9%",Single Malt Scotch,94,700,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Bottled to celebrate the 125th Anniversary of the distillery. Classic Bunnahabhain-toffeed and quite nutty. Almost rummy in nature, with rich molasses notes throughout and layers of sweetness. Some salt emerges on occasion, as do notes of honey, coconut, and candied fruit, with a pleasingly dry, gently spicy finish to round everything out. Surprisingly youthful for its age, nicely balanced, and very drinkable. A great Bunnahabhain!",
"The Dalmore Stillman's Dram 28 Year Old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,94,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"For the past several years, the Stillman’s Dram expression of The Dalmore has been a 30 year old. This new 28 year old expression, besides being two years younger, is also slightly less sherried. In this instance, I feel that both have enhanced the whisky. Trimming back on the sherry and oak allows the whisky’s trademark orange marmalade, complex spice, and briny freshness to shine through. This one is lively, dynamic, evolving, well-balanced, and always entertaining. The best Dalmore Stillman’s Dram in years.",
"Glendronach 33 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,94,400,101 to 500 Dollars,"Matured entirely in oloroso sherry butts, this whisky is chock-full of lush fruit, roasted nuts, deep spice notes, and a hint of damp smoke. It is wonderfully integrated, with incredible depth and maturity without being tired-and it expresses a soothing quality that doesn’t quit. It is stunning throughout and more polished and rounded than the 1968 Vintage released a while back, which, while enjoyable, was a tad sappy and a bit too oaky at times. This whisky is easily one of the 10 best new whiskies for 2005, and worth every penny. Get a bottle while you can. 
",
"Highland Park 34 year old 1971 vintage (Cask #8363), 53%",Single Malt Scotch,94,325,101 to 500 Dollars,"Rummy molasses and toffee sweetness intertwine with roasted nuts and bright, juicy fruit. Suggestions of fig, lavender, leather, and tobacco throughout, with a hint of peat and polished oak on the finish. Not quite as refined as the Highland Park 18 year old, but it makes up for this with its dynamic personality. A delicious ultra-mature, sherry cask-aged whisky. (A Binny’s Beverage Depot exclusive.)",
"Highland Park  1977 vintage 29 year old (Cask #7957), 48.5%",Single Malt Scotch,94,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"A delicious, well-balanced, ultra-matured expression of Highland Park. Toffee apples, molasses, and vanilla fudge provide a sweet foundation, with evolving notes of dark chocolate, dry spicy oak, tobacco, subtle smoke, and lingering brine on the finish. Nicely done. (Bottled for Old Oaks Cigar & Wine Company)",
"Highland Park 32 year old 1973 Vintage (Cask #8375), 41.3%",Single Malt Scotch,94,350,101 to 500 Dollars,"An essay in elegance. Silky and soft in texture, and very clean. Notes of peaches and cream, vanilla wafer, soft honey and fruit gum drops. Subtler notes of tropical fruit (pineapple, lemon, coconut), demerara sugar, heather, and anise. Polished oak adds structure and contrast, with a very elegant finish. Hard to believe this whisky is 32 years old. It's lighter and more elegant than the equally splendid Highland Park 30 year old, which I rated a 94 in the last issue. (Bottled exclusively for Park Avenue Liquors.)",
"Highland Park 30 Year Old, 48.1%",Single Malt Scotch,94,350,101 to 500 Dollars,"An exemplary Highland Park. There's certainly plenty of sherry influence in this whisky and it is complementary. (About 2/3 of the whisky was aged on sherry casks, and a lot of these casks were second fill.) The whisky enjoys a delicious foundation of toffee, fruit (lemon, plum, blueberries) and dark chocolate. It continues to develop and evolve on the palate, with emerging notes of heather, nougat, lavender, delicate peat and complex dried spice (especially cinnamon and nutmeg) to balance the sweeter notes. The extra alcohol is also a bonus, providing a drying balance to the whisky's sweetness. Whiskies like this one remind me why I fell in love with whisky in the first place.",
"The Macallan 17 year old Fine Oak, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,94,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Another of the Fine Oak series (aged in both bourbon and sherry casks), which will debut in the U.S. in March. Of the five Fine Oak expressions that will be in the U.S. (10, 15, 17, 21, and 30 year old), this is my favorite, slightly besting the 15 year old. Lovely sweet notes (creamy vanilla, light toffee, marshmallow, shortbread, and a kiss of honey) are accompanied by bright fruit (multi-layered citrus) and potpourri of dried spices, along with a hint of nut and wisp of smoke. A very refined and sophisticated whisky.",
"White Bowmore 43 year old 1964 vintage, 42.8%",Single Malt Scotch,94,6000,5001 to 10000 Dollars,"I like this Bowmore better than all the previous bourbon oak-aged, ultra-mature Bowmore whiskies that have been released over the past fifteen years (there have been several). The oak is always present, but not dominant. The whisky really evolves on the palate, just like the Black Bowmore releases. This emphasis here is on fruit, bright fruit: peach, tangerine, mango, ripe melon, and pineapple. There’s a soft, gentle side to the whisky, too, enhanced by sweeter notes of pancake syrup, orange creamsicle, and white chocolate. Heavy oak notes emerge, along with teasing, earthy smoke, to give the whisky depth and bottom notes. The smoke and oak linger long on the finish. Very contemplative. In short, an outstanding whisky, but not quite reaching the excellence of Black Bowmore. 
   (Allocation information: 732 bottles available worldwide; 40 bottles are being allocated for the U.S., half of the quantity of Black Bowmore which was released earlier this year.)

"The Balvenie Vintage Cask 1976 vintage, 53%",Single Malt Scotch,94,800,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Very spicy and complex, with incredible depth. Once again, this 30-plus year old whisky proves the aging ability of Balvenie. Still quite vibrant and invigorating for such maturity. The classic Balvenie honey note is there, but more reserved, along with graham cracker, vanilla wafer, citrus peel, raspberry (red and black), nectarine, and polished oak. Long, spicy finish. Another outstanding Balvenie Vintage Cask. Although, I look at the price and remember how shocked I was when the Balvenie vintages were selling for $400.",
"Glenmorangie Astar 2017 Release, 52.5%",Single Malt Scotch,94,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"An innovative offering made with a proportion of chocolate malt and matured in virgin American oak. Some of the component whiskies are between 35 and 40 years old. Milk chocolate, honey, orange marmalade, sultanas, and spice on the inviting nose. The palate is rich and full, with malt, dates, Jaffa oranges, dark chocolate, and coffee beans. Long and spicy in the drying finish. Glenmorangie at its very best.",
"The Macallan 1824 Limited Release, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,94,1900,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Antique amber. The darkest and most decadent of the four. Quite viscous and soothing, with well-layered notes of apple pie, marmalade, and maple syrup balanced by dried fruits, ginger, polished leather, tobacco, and resinous oak. One to sip and savor very slowly. (This whisky is much better than the last ultra-premium release, the Macallan 55 year old in the Lalique Decanter, and thousands of dollars less.)",
"Black Bull, 30 year old, 50%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Well, what have we here? A blend of 50% malt and 50% grain (a very high malt content for a blend), and bottled at 50%, too! The whisky was blended first (very unusual), before being aged in sherry casks for its entire life. Antique amber/chestnut color. Full sherry impact, but never cloying -- the higher alcohol level and grain whisky cut through the sherry and add balance and drinkability. This is a fruity-confection delight, with raisin chutney, fig cake, orange almond scone, and chocolate-covered cherry. Add to the mix richly textured toffee, old oak, polished leather, and a cinnamon-spiced tobacco finish. A rare treat! A great old blend that malt drinkers will embrace.",
"Highland Park 1964 vintage, 42.2%",Single Malt Scotch,94,6088,5001 to 10000 Dollars,"A marriage of two casks (refill hogsheads). Significantly darker in color than the 1968 vintage. Darker (and more serious) in personality, too. Red berries (strawberry, raspberry), rhubarb, plum, oak sap, vanilla bean, smoldering peat, coffee grounds, toasted almond, and dusty malt. The finish is long and contemplative, with notes of polished leather, juicy oak, and telicherry peppercorns. £3,750",
"Glengoyne 40 year old, 45.9%",Single Malt Scotch,94,5730,5001 to 10000 Dollars,"Aged in sherry butts, which is a departure from some of the older Glengoyne vintage samples I have which show more bourbon barrel characteristics. It is a very fruity, spicy, textural dram, with spiced apple, red raspberry, strawberry, plum, golden raisin, fried plantain, and creme brulee. Good grip on the finish, with grape stems and warming spice (cinnamon, cracked peppercorn, and clove). I love the balance on this whisky. It has aged very gracefully. (Limited to 250 bottles worldwide.)",
"Compass Box The Peat Monster, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,94,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"The formula for this whisky has changed slightly since its inception -- and I think for the better. They've added some Laphroaig into the mix of Caol Ila and Ardmore. This whisky demonstrates the layered complexity that can be achieved by marrying whisky from different distilleries and different regions. I particularly enjoy the rich maltiness and oily texture that provide firm bedding and flavor contrast to the classic Islay notes: tar, boat docks, brine, smoked olive, seaweed, and kiln ash. More subtle cracked peppercorn, mustard seed, and citrus fruit add complexity. Long, warming finish. Amazing how a small change in composition can significantly benefit the overall flavor profile of a whisky.",
"Glenlivet Archive 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"An impressive single cask bottling of Glenfiddich. It really shows the natural potential of this distillery. Nothing fancy here, just the pure elegance of Glenfiddich. Notes of shortbread, demerara sugar, and white chocolate, spiced with toasted nuts, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Very clean and polished.",
"Highland Park 1970 vintage, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,94,3500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"This limited edition bottling consists of a marriage of both European and American oak. Still lively for its age, and beautifully balanced. Bountiful golden fruit (sultana, pineapple upside down cake, tangerine, overripe nectarine) balanced by soothing, creamy vanilla. A peppering of dried spice, chamomile tea, toasted oak, cigar box, and subtle smoke round out the palate. Soft and seductive. (Not available in the U.S.) £2,250",
"GlenDronach Grandeur 31 year old, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,94,700,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The new ultra-mature release, following its 33 year old predecessor (bottled by previous owners). It’s nice to see the higher ABV, given that the 33 year old was only 40%. Very soothing. Quite deep on the nose and viscous (almost sappy) on the palate, with gobs of juicy oak and old oak (its age is obvious but not imposing), dark raisin, black raspberry, orange marmalade, roasted nuts, and freshly roasted coffee beans. All of this is peppered with cinnamon, ginger, and charcoal. Polished leather on the finish. I like that it’s sherried, and the sherry is kept in balance. Those of you who liked the 33 year old will also enjoy this one (assuming you can afford it).",
"Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2010), 56.5%",Single Malt Scotch,94,109,101 to 500 Dollars,"There’s precious little reticence about this beast, which leaps out of the glass blowing peat smoke everywhere — then comes raffia, Lapsang Souchong tea, seashore, wet rocks, Elastoplast, talcum powder, bog myrtle (laurel), vetiver, and the aromas of a just-expunged peat bonfire with apples baking on it. Huge and complex, in other words. The palate starts with a fug of smoke being belched at you (non-peat freaks look away, now) then distinct saltiness enlivens the tongue before everything plunges down; intense sweetness takes charge for a moment before it shifts into charred creosoted timbers. This begs for some water, and when it’s added, out comes sandalwood and peat smoke and tar and an orris root-like character — it’s not often I get gin-like notes on Lagavulin, but it’s here — which rolls over you as you roll over and succumb to its power. After this year’s sublime distillery-only bottling, it’s clear that Lagavulin is in a real purple patch. Superb.",
"Aberfeldy 14 year old Single Cask, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,94,181,101 to 500 Dollars,"Single cask Aberfeldy bottlings are very few and far between, and this is a stunner! After hogshead maturation the whisky ultimately underwent a period of finishing in an ex-sherry cask prior to bottling. The nose offers sultanas, raisins, and hot chocolate. Developing vanilla and a hint of over-ripe bananas. Finally, burnt sugar and caramel. Insinuating and syrupy on the palate, with apricots, dried fruits, honey, and sherry. Gently spicy and warming, with licorice in the notably long finish. £115",
"Highland Park 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,94,112,101 to 500 Dollars,"Introduced to the Highland Park portfolio in 1997. Gentle peat, soft toffee, floral notes, and honey on the beautifully fragrant nose. Superbly balanced on the velvety palate, with brittle toffee, stewed fruits, peat, honey, and a hint of coffee. Smoke and more toffee mingle in the long, elegant finish.",
"The Balvenie Tun 1401 (Batch #3), 50.3%",Single Malt Scotch,94,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"A combination of three sherry butts and seven bourbon casks. This is a complex, dynamic whisky, loaded with lush, layered ripe fruit (red berries, tropical fruit, honeyed apricot, raisin), toffee, oak resin, polished leather, and well-defined spice notes (cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, clove). Long, warming finish. (Exclusive to the U.S.)",
"Blue Hanger 6th Release Berry Bros. & Rudd, 45.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,94,84,0 to 100 Dollars,"If you want proof that blended malts can be world class, you'll find it in any bottle of Blue Hanger. Lovingly created by Berry Bros. whisky maker Doug McIvor, every release has been exceptional. Even by the series’ own high standards, this sixth release surpasses itself. The nose is fresh, clean, and citrusy, with wafts of sherry. But there are smoky hints, too. And it's that peaty, earthy note on the palate that gives this release a new dimension, enriching the fruity Speyside sweetness at the whisky's core. The age and quality of the malt asserts itself throughout. This really is stunning stuff. £68",
"Brora 35 year old Special Release 2012, 48.1%",Single Malt Scotch,94,645,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Previous Broras in the Diageo Special Release series have set the bar remarkably high, and this, the eleventh such bottling, does not disappoint. The component whiskies were distilled during 1976 and 1977 and matured in refill American oak casks. The nose offers lemon and contrasting vanilla and honeycomb aromas. Musty malt and coal in the background. The citrus and honey themes continue into the slightly earthy, peppery palate, while French mustard and coal figure in the drying finish. 1,566 bottles.",
"Johnnie Walker The Casks Edition, 55.8%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"You don't mess with the Johnnie Walker brand name casually, so we expect greatness, and boy, do we get it here. This has a dusty, smoky nose with dried apricot and grape, and the whisky is gossamer-soft on the palate, with sweet pear and honey evolving on top of an oaky rich heart before a tidal wave of pepper and peat, and a delightful spice smoke and oak conclusion. Magnificent. ",
"Brora 40 year old Single Cask 1972 Vintage, 59.1%",Single Malt Scotch,94,11824,10001 and above,"Just 160 bottles of 1972 Brora are available through UK World of Whiskies and World Duty Free Group stores. The oldest bottling of Brora to date was distilled using heavily-peated malt. A big hit of oily peat on the early nose, with malt, dried fruit, and black pepper. Mildly medicinal. The palate yields bonfire ash, licorice, honey, more pepper, and well-integrated oak. The finish is long, with peat smoke, plain chocolate, and tannins lingering in harmony. Complex and rewarding. £7,000",
"The John Walker, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,3500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"The pinnacle of the current Johnnie Walker range, this is a rare, inimitable blend of just nine whiskies. It exudes the aromas of ripe bananitos, whole mango, satsuma, vanilla seeds, barley awns, butter biscuits, and crystallized pineapple. The supple grain sustains indulgent, characterful malts creating a weighty, smooth mouthfeel. I’m smitten by the vanilla creaminess, burgeoning deep fruit layers, how it swells with a satisfying snuffbox smokiness. A beautifully styled blend delivering a captivating, sensuous experience. (330 bottles only)",
"Glenfarclas Family Casks 1987 (Cask #3829), 48%",Single Malt Scotch,94,387,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is the bomb. Savory and lightly meaty, but sweetened by plum sauce; there’s even some strawberry around the fringes. You could see how with another 30 years this would end up like the ’54. Elegant yet powerful, there’s sandalwood incense, marmalade, even a little dried mango. The distillery’s density is balanced by this fruit. Lush with supple tannins and at its best neat. From a refill butt, this is an exemplary sherried malt. £230",
"Brora 1978 35 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 48.6%",Single Malt Scotch,94,1250,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"This is the 13th annual release of Brora, which has been aged in refill American oak and refill European oak casks. Hessian and hemp on the early nose, with a whiff of ozone, discreet peat, and old tar. Fragrant and fruity notes develop, with ripe apples, and a hint of honey. The palate is waxy, sweet, and spicy, with heather and ginger. Mildly medicinal and smoky. Dries steadily in the finish to aniseed, black pepper, dark chocolate, and fruity tannins. (2,964 bottles)",
"Scotch Malt Whisky Society Hunting Hound on Holiday 4.180 24 year old 1989, 51.3%",Single Malt Scotch,94,225,101 to 500 Dollars,"From the nose you can tell this is a special whisky, with old, dark, lacquered wood, dusty cigar box, and sea salt combined with dark sweet cherry and a hint of rancio. On the palate it gets even better, with lush, dark cherry perfectly balanced and integrated with oak spice, salt, and peat smoke. There’s clear rancio in the center of it all that's utterly delicious. This stunner finishes with a long, slightly spicy, and entirely lovely finish. (Park Avenue Liquor only)",
"Royal Salute 62 Gun Salute, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,3000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Named after the gun rounds fired on Royal anniversaries at the Tower of London. Heightened sherry tones with dark Madagascar chocolate, Brazil nut, fondant cream, and faint espresso indulge the nose. One heavenly sip reveals a velvety smooth whisky, thick and sticky, all revolving around the chocolate and nut, with a little support from dark fruits. You can chew over this for hours as the finish soft-pedals the main themes. A work of genius.",
"Black Bull 40 year old 7th release, 47.6%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,1400,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Jaw-dropping: Aberlour 1973, Bunnahabhain 1968 and 1969, Bowmore 1968, Caperdonich 1972, Glen Grant 1974, Glenfarclas 1966, Glenlivet 1968 and 1970, Highland Park 1967 and 1970, and Macallan 1969.

Rich fruitcake, jellied fruit, and bramble, then spices course through the mouth: chili heat, black pepper, and raw ginger. Final phase has chocolate praline, growing milky, nutty, and soothing. Exceptional lengthy finish with reignited spices. Chivas 18 goes electric. (Travel Retail exclusive)",
"Highland Park 21 year old, 47.5%",Single Malt Scotch,93,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Surprisingly clean and youthful for a 30 year old, both on the nose and palate. Complex, too, with a sea breeze freshness, vanilla malt, polished oak spice, smoked seaweed, lightly tarred boat docks, toasted nuts, and lingering telicherry pepper. Mature, yet still quite powerful. Rivals the original Talisker 25 year old and the Talisker 18 year old as one of the finest Talisker whiskies ever released.",
"Compass Box Phenomenology, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,180,101 to 500 Dollars,"The first bottling of Astar was released in 2008. The 2017 release was matured in casks made of oak from Missouri’s Ozark Mountains. The nose is floral, with rosehips, orange blossom, and milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight.

Extremely accomplished. (Individual reviewer rating: 93)",

"Ardbeg Uigeadail, 54.2%",Single Malt Scotch,94,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"The nose has honey, caramelized apples, Pixy Stix, pears in cream, faint pepper, ground coriander, and salty driftwood. It’s teeth-coating with golden syrup sugariness, the silky texture meting out pears, apples, sweet barley notes, and crunchy spices, before a vanilla phase gives way to black pepper, licorice, and smoke. Mouth-numbing finish of long-active spices over vanilla. (7,908 bottles)",
"Samaroli Over an Islay Rainbow 2017 Edition, 45%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,94,471,101 to 500 Dollars,"The third and most exclusive release in Bowmore’s Vault Legends Collection was matured for 50 years in bourbon hogshead #5675.

Raisin, fig, grape skins, furniture polish, menthol tobacco, toasted wood, asphalt, and medicinal iodine on the nose. Chewy, robust, and rich on the palate, the peat keeps the cask’s sweetness in check, as raisin, orange marmalade, dark chocolate, fruit leather, hefty spice, roasted nuts, and oak vie with iodine, saline, and ash. Pepper slides into oak and tobacco on the finish, with dark-skinned fruit and menthol lingering. (Julio's Liquors exclusive; 288 bottles)",
"Single Malts of Scotland 21 year old Glenburgie 1998 Single Cask (Cask No. 900896), 55.2%",Single Malt Scotch,94,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Exhibit A for never judging a whisky by its color: This straw-pale malt shows depth and complexity many sherry-dark whiskies would envy. The nose is briny and smoky, with a seaweed character; lemon poppyseed muffin and almond cake are present without water. Add a few drops, however, and fresh orchard fruit emerges, sweet and clean, and carries into the rounded, silky palate where it mingles with salt water, black pepper, a squeeze of lemon, and smoky peat. Good length on the finish, which has oak, nuts, and cigar wrapper. A paragon of balance. (240 bottles)",

There’s also dark chocolate, hazelnuts, and leather. The palate is equally thick and chewy, offering figs, raisins, dark chocolate, coffee bean, and raspberry cake filling, as well as green apple and guava candy showing this whisky’s maturity. It finishes with coffee, chocolate, dark berries, white pepper, orange pith, and oak that verges on bitterness, but never tips over the edge. Stately and dignified. (405 bottles; U.S. exclusive)",

The palate delivers on that aromatic promise, bursting with guava and papaya, as well as mouth-puckering citrus and almond pastry. The lengthy finish is still fruity but leans into dryness, with almond and clean cereal notes and, at the last, a wisp of cigar. Don’t be afraid to add water if you wish to reduce the alcohol; the intense flavors remain. (251 bottles; U.S. exclusive)",
"Port Ellen Prima & Ultima 40 year old 1979 (Cask No. 6422), 51.2%",Single Malt Scotch,94,25899,10001 and above,"Sweet, smoky, meaty peat aromas mingle with vanilla saltwater taffy, blueberry, dried
ginger, and bright bubble gum. The palate is consistent, juxtaposing fruity
spirit—orange, lemon, strawberry, blueberry—with savory peat smoke. Vanilla, nuts,
black pepper, cinnamon, and well-integrated oak are also at play. The finish lingers
with the sweet-savory pleasure of a cigar, nutty oak, spice, and peat. Does well with
water, showing excellent development. (208 bottles)",
"Benriach The Smoky Twelve, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,94,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Rich sherried fruit aromas, machine oil, camphor, coal dust, marzipan, and freshly
polished oak. Full and sweet on the early palate, then drying, with black coffee,
licorice, and the distinctive flavor of coal. A long finish, with dark chocolate and
cherry liqueur. No negative oakiness despite its age. Superb! Price is for entire Prima
& Ultima Collection, of which this whisky is a part. (352 bottles) £20,000",
"Johnnie Walker Blue Label Legendary Eight, 43.8%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,350,101 to 500 Dollars,"The nose opens with coal-fire smoke and musty orchard fruits, which freshen in time.
Peaches and mandarins, a hint of brine, and lit cigar. Remarkably vivid orange notes
on the palate, with coal, sea salt, and black tea. Black pepper, tar, and persistent tangy
orange notes in the long finish. Price is for entire Prima & Ultima Collection, of
which this whisky is a part. (436 bottles) £20,000

"Single Malts of Scotland 14 year old An Orkney Distillery Single Cask (Distilled in 2006; Cask No. 45), 60.4%",Single Malt Scotch,94,145,101 to 500 Dollars,"

Apples, pound cake, treacle, almond nougat, and vanilla aromas set up the palate’s inherent sweetness, but pay attention to the note of oyster shell minerality and wafting woodsmoke, so well integrated as to be hardly noticeable—at least until you take a sip. Sweet smoke drifts over toasted almond, Golden Delicious apple, cinnamon, and Swiss Miss hot cocoa, all sprinkled with smoked salt. It finishes with grilled apple and flavored tobacco, the smoke persistent but never ashy, and a silky texture that’s as gentle as a caress.(Individual reviewer rating: 92)",
"Single Malts of Scotland 23 year old Imperial Single Cask (Distilled in 1997; Cask No. 2798), 45.4%",Single Malt Scotch,94,335,101 to 500 Dollars,"A blend of eight whiskies including Oban, Brora, Cambus, and Lagavulin, producing a sweet yet complex dram that may surprise regular Blue Label drinkers. The nose has peach, marmalade, brown sugar sprinkled on caramel, fine pepper, soft peatiness, oiled wood, and campfire smokiness. The sugary palate yields toffee apple, fudge, vanilla, dried fruit, peach, and gentle spice, then fiery smoke, pepper, cocoa, milky coffee, and chocolate. Legendary indeed.",
"Benriach The Smoky Twelve, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,94,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"

Let this whisky glide into your glass without hesitation: aromas of poached pear, hazelnuts, honey, marmalade, and ginger jam turn bright and fresh with water. The oleaginous palate is waxy in both texture and flavor, slick with candied citrus and subtle spice that builds into a resonant crescendo. That spice wave meets with savory hazelnut, tobacco, and leathery oak on the finish, lasting for minutes without slackening. (300 bottles; U.S. exclusive)",
"Ardbeg 5 year old Wee Beastie, 47.4%",Single Malt Scotch,94,47,0 to 100 Dollars,"

Spirit, not cask, drives this whisky’s character, with bright notes of lemon and lime, green apple candy, guava, vanilla, and ginger nut cookies creating an inviting and zesty nose. More lemon and lime, plus tangerine, on the palate, along with lively spices—ginger, white pepper, and cinnamon—toasted almonds, baking chocolate, and leather. With water, the profile flips as spices turn savory and chocolate and nuts take on a sweeter tone; the transformation is unexpected, but lovely. Tobacco, coffee bean, and leathery oak on the finish. (144 bottles; U.S. exclusive)",
"Black Bottle, 10 year old, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,34,0 to 100 Dollars,"

Benriach is a sleeper of a single malt, but that’s about to change. Part of a 2020 relaunch of its core line, this grabbed our attention with its sophistication, breadth of flavors, and lovely refinement. Much of the credit surely goes to master blender Rachel Barrie for creating a smoky whisky that both peat lovers and the peat-wary can enjoy. Rather than medicinal intensity, the peat is redolent of gentle, sweetly smoky fruits that integrate seamlessly with notes of vanilla, toasted almond, chocolate, blueberry, and bacon. It beckons like the wafting smoke of a warming autumn bonfire, then welcomes with its lush and velvety embrace. Number 3 in the 2020 Top 20",
"The Balvenie 1974 vintage (Cask #17893), 52.8%",Single Malt Scotch,93,600,501 to 1000 Dollars,"

The youthful age statement may take many scotch drinkers by surprise, but don’t let double-digit bias prevent you from enjoying this exciting yet easy-drinking peat bomb. Salt water and seaweed, smoke and sweet peat tussle on the nose, while vanilla, fresh berries, and ample nuttiness spread out and take hold. The structured, balanced palate is creamy, nutty, and spiced, showcasing brown-sugar bacon, smoked salt, milk chocolate, pepper, and well-integrated oak, all wrapped up like a cigar with flakes of ash and sustained smoke. This precocious youngster shows more complexity than some whiskies twice its age, making it a remarkable find. Number 6 in the 2020 Top 20",
The Balvenie 30 year old 1973 Vintage (Cask #9219),Single Malt Scotch,93,400,101 to 500 Dollars,"Black Bottle is unique in that it combines seven different Islay whiskies with grain whisky. This produces a whisky with a beautifully rounded Islay character that will satisfy the discriminating “peat-head,” the drinkability of a blended scotch, and plenty of complexity. For a blend, there’s heft to the whisky. I enjoy the interplay between the peat smoke, brine, seaweed, its firm, malty foundation and pleasingly dry finish. 
",
"The Balvenie 25 year old, 46.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"The newest offering from the impressive Balvenie vintage cask line. Honey, caramel custard, and Seville orange notes, with evolving -- and increasingly noticeable -- dried spice, oak resin, and leather that integrates well with the sweet, fruity notes. Incredible depth and complexity. The Balvenie vintage reputation remains intact.",
"Bowmore 16 year old 1989 vintage, 51.8%",Single Malt Scotch,93,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"The last Balvenie Vintage whisky I tasted that was this old was the exceptional 1966 Vintage. This new vintage has some big shoes (or should I say bottles?) to fill, so how does it stand up to the 1966 Vintage? This 1973 Vintage is equally as impressive. In contrast to the massive, evolving, sherry-influenced 30 year old reviewed below, this one shows more subtlety and finesse. It is also a very clean and polished affair-signs of an obviously excellent cask. A honeyed, malty foundation incorporates notes of dried fruit (orange, lemon), complex spice (vanilla, cinnamon, sandalwood), and subtle herbs. Very contemplative.",
"Bruichladdich Legacy III 35 year old 1968 vintage, 40.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,430,101 to 500 Dollars,"Deep amber color. Exotic aromas of honey, vanilla, and tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple, mango). Medium to full in body, and rich in texture. The palate delivers what the aroma promises-honey, vanilla, and more tropical fruit, with a somewhat dry and rather lengthy finish. The Balvenie distillery enjoys an excellent reputation. The older expressions are particularly noteworthy. They age very gracefully. This one is a pure joy to drink.",
"Murray McDavid 'Mission' (distilled at Clynelish) 1986, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"No frills here, just pure, unadulterated Bowmore. This Islay whisky speaks of its location in a very pure and natural way. I find invigorating brine, seaweed, green olive, and fishnets, along with the classic Bowmore peat smoke. All these flavors are softened by gentle vanilla and honeyed malt, while background tropical fruit add complexity. 
",
"Cragganmore, 29 year old, 52.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"This gem is soft and seductive in personality. It is also very clean and still quite fresh for its age-obviously aged in an excellent cask. You'll find a bed of gentle sweetness, reminding me of coconut cream and vanilla mousse. A mélange of fruit (melon, black raspberries, strawberries) marries perfectly with the sweetness. Fresh brine notes and licorice root emerge on the palate and become more prominent towards the finish. This Legacy III is more polished and rounded, and not as tired or woody when compared to the recent 40 year old bottling. And the 40 year old, at $2,200 a pop, is also about five times more expensive.",
"The Dalmore 1973 Vintage Gonzalez Byass Sherry Cask Finish, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,93,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"Deep gold color. Fresh, exciting, spicy aroma of brine, exotic pepper, seaweed, and raw fruit, with interwoven notes of delicate peat and caramel. Full-bodied and muscular. Flavors are incredibly vibrant and dynamic-almost challenging-and are similar to its aroma. Salty, peppery, intense finish. 
",
"Glenfiddich 1973 Vintage (Cask #9874), 46.5%",Single Malt Scotch,93,600,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Shimmering gold Aroma: Very complex, with a potpourri of spicy, herbal notes. There’s a lot going on here. Nice depth too. Palate: Similar to its aroma, nicely balanced, and evolving. Lingering, spicy finish. 
",
"Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1964 vintage, 44.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,2000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"A thick, lush whisky. Notes of honey-drenched citrus, orange marmalade, chewy toffee and almonds, peppered with that classic coastal brine freshness and background spice I have come to love in Dalmore. Long, contemplative finish. This whisky packs plenty of freshness and liveliness for 30 years on oak and is a pure joy to drink.",
"Ardbeg Airidh Nam Beist 1990 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,92,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"

There’s something for everyone in this whisky, whose citrus brightness acts as a deft foil for darker earthy notes, showcasing the Highland distillery’s range. Lemon, orange marmalade, dried fig, golden raisin, milk chocolate, and a touch of leather on the nose; then more marmalade, chocolate, toasted nuts, cinnamon, and lemon pepper on the creamy, viscous palate. Still fresh with citrus, the finish slowly gives way to savory tobacco, leather, cocoa powder, and coffee bean. Subtle, nuanced, and perfectly balanced: a sleeper hit. Number 11 in the 2020 Top 20",
"Highland Park 1983 vintage 23 year old (Cask #691), 59.8%",Single Malt Scotch,93,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"The fifth in a series of Glenlivet Cellar Collection whiskies. This is a very complex whisky, with exotic notes of oak, sultana, vanilla cream, almonds, and evergreen. These notes are quite floral on the nose and well balanced, with no hint of excessive aging. The palate is polished, deep, and continuously evolving, with a long spicy finish. The oak notes reveal that this whisky has some years on it, but they in no way dominate or detract from the other flavors. An outstanding effort! This rivals the 1959 vintages as the best of the Cellar Collection releases. You’ll need deep pockets, though.",
"Longrow 1974, 25 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,525,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Amber chestnut color. Aromas of mature oak, leather, ripe fruit, and toffee, are very deep and well balanced. Its flavors are rich and enveloping, with notes of treacle, toffee, roasted nuts, and a long, spicy, woody finish that lingers.",
"The Macallan 50 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,3500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Very sophisticated and subtly complex. Perhaps the lightest-colored of the bunch. Fresh, appetizing brine and spice (cinnamon, vanilla, white pepper, and clove) on a bed of soft honey and creamy vanilla, with just a hint of fruit. The notes are bright, clean, and tight. Spicy, briny finish. A beautifully delicate Highland Park. (Bottled for Green’s)",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Mortlach), 11 year old,k 1993 vintage, 60.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Gold color. Peaty, smoky, mature aromas, with notes of damp earth, pencil shavings, seaweed, brine, and vanilla. Oily, viscous body. Flavors are similar to its aroma, with a spicy, salty, black pepper, dryish finish. 
",
"Springbank 35 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,580,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Amber-chestnut color. Aromas are very mature and so thick, one almost needs a knife to cut it. Notes of dried fruit (orange, lemons, pineapple) and wood spices (especially clove), with more than a suggestion of peat smoke. Thick, enveloping texture-like a warm coat on a bitterly cold day. Very mature. One can easily deduce this is a very old whisky-the woodiness is evident on the palate. But it is not in excess. There’s plenty of dried fruit, enticing wood spices, and peat to keep the palate entertained, all the way through to its very long, dry finish.",
"Murray McDavid (distilled at Springbank) 1965 34 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Full-flavored, confident, and very dynamic. Bright fruit, teasing toffee, complex spices, cereal grain, and underlying light leather notes are all tightly integrated. Think an 11 year old whisky can’t be mature or complex? Think again! A Speyside powerhouse! (Available in the Chicago area.) 
",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Strathisla), 35 year old, Cask #7009, 45.1%",Single Malt Scotch,93,240,101 to 500 Dollars,"Antique amber color. Mature complex aromas-especially in wood spice notes. In addition to wood spices, I also found notes of roasted nuts, coconuts, orange marmalade, anise, and subtle brine. Thick and syrupy in texture, with complex flavors that echo its aroma. The depth on the palate is incredible! Long lingering finish.",
"Talisker 30 year old, 51.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"Antique amber color. Ripe, fallen fruit aromas laced with coconut, marshmallow, and almonds. The sherry cask influence is very prominent on the nose, but the Springbank ""brine"" character still manages to fight through. Full bodied, with a soothing texture. Huge flavors with great balance and depth, consisting of exotic fruits, complex wood spices, brine, and coconut. Long, lingering satisfying finish.",
"Talisker 18 year old, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,93,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Aromatically fruity and quite full, with wonderful depth on the nose and palate. The fruit (golden raisins, apricot, red licorice, papaya) is balanced by restrained honey, vanilla, and fennel. The whisky is always dry but never excessively so. A delicious, ultra-mature whisky. 
",
"Blue Hanger 7th Release Limited Edition, 45.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Talisker is a Special Releases favorite, and this bottling, the oldest ever marketed by the distillery, is actually the sixteenth. Distillation was in 1977, and maturation has taken place in both American and European oak refill casks. Soft wood smoke, sultana, nutmeg, and chili powder on the nose. Dried fruits, vanilla, and malt merge with more chili and savory notes, plus newly-dug soil on the complex palate. A touch of brine, orange peel, and bonfire in the finish. 3,090 bottles. ",
"Exclusive Blend 1991 21 year old, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"What a success story. After six releases in a decade, there have been three just this year. This release is especially for the States, and it's a fireball. There are dried fruits and dusty bookshelves on the nose, and tropical fruits with water. On the palate it's a big, peaty, rich whisky with licorice and more of the pineapple, kiwifruit, and guava. You get the whole fairground in the finale, with candy, fruit, and smoke. Excellent.",
"Highland Park 40 year old, 48.3%",Single Malt Scotch,93,1900,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"The good news: This is one of the best Highland Park whiskies I have ever tasted. The bad news: it’s the new release for Travel Retail (formerly Duty Free). It’s lush, well-balanced, and very complex. Well-defined notes of toffee, candied fruit, and roasted nuts are accentuated by background honey, chocolate mousse, and smoke. Here’s the icing on the cake: it’s bottled at 47.5%, which really allows the flavors to shine. If you’re going overseas, consider tracking down a bottle.",
"Longrow 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,280,101 to 500 Dollars,"A polished, very elegant expression with subtle complexity throughout. Notes of squeaky-clean fruit (tangerine, peach, nectarine, kiwi) in light syrup. Vibrant spice (cinnamon, white pepper, anise), creamy vanilla, and almond evolve on the palate, leading to a gentle finish. Surprisingly lively for a whisky more than 30 years old. When I think of great Glenrothes vintages, I go back to the 1972 vintage for comparison. Both are comparable in quality, with the 1972 vintage showing darker sugars, more weight, and more roasted nuts. 
",
"Glenlivet XXV 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,350,101 to 500 Dollars,"Antique copper color, with some streaks of gold. A complex array of dried fruit on the nose, peppered with dried spice, orange marmalade, dark chocolate, and wood shavings. On the palate, the immediate impact is once again marmalade, followed briefly by bramble before drier notes of dark chocolate, wood shavings, anise, and subtle smoke emerge. Dry and spicy on the finish, but never austere. A delicious, contemplative 40 year old Highland Park that has aged gracefully.

This is a permanent addition to the range. Out of curiosity, I tasted it next to the other great Highland Parks (the 30 year old and several very good single cask bottlings over 30 years old). This whisky is in the same league as the others. Its only down side is that it’s a lot more expensive than the others.",
"Glenmorangie Astar, 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,93,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"Straw/honey color. Light to medium weight, with a slightly oily texture. Shy on the nose, but makes up for it on the finish. Fresh brine, toasted coconut, bright citrus fruit, and subtle mint on a bed of vanilla cream and honeyed malt. The peat smoke is restrained on the nose, but is more assertive on the palate, and it really kicks in on the finish, which is briny, smoky, appetizing, and long. The best Longrow since the 1974 vintage. If it would only just open up a little more on the nose it would challenge the best from ‘73 and ‘74. (Only 120 bottles for the U.S.)
",
"The Dalmore 40 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,93,3000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Finished in first-fill sherry casks for two years. My feeling on any whisky finished in a different cask is this: it should give as much to the flavor profile as it takes away. In this instance, I feel it has, and more. It’s not as nimble as younger versions, but the sherry, along with the extra aging, contributes a silky texture and a richer, fuller dimension to the whisky. I can still detect some of the peach, vanilla, tropical fruit, and honeyed malt I enjoy in younger expressions, but its key flavor components are toffee, honey-dipped citrus, red licorice, chocolate-covered almonds, and fig, along with dried spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, mint tea) that emerges on the palate and peaks on the finish. The flavors are seamless and elegantly balanced.",
"Cutty Sark, 25 year old, 45.7%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,170,101 to 500 Dollars,"Astar’s flavor profile is similar to Glenmorangie 10 year old in many respects, showing a superb balance of sweetness, fruit, and spice. It’s not as subtle as the 10 year old expression, but it is creamier, richer, and fleshier, with loads of honeyed vanilla, coconut cream pie, toasted almond, vibrant spice (cinnamon, mint), and a basketful of citrus and summer fruits. The fact that it is bottled at 100 British Proof (57.1% abv) just accentuates every flavor and helps to make this whisky quite invigorating. Imagine Glenmorangie 10 year old with a shot of testosterone. I don’t rate very many ten year old (or younger ) whiskies over 90. This whisky has certainly earned it.",
"Port Ellen, 30 year old (2009 Release), 57.7%, ",Single Malt Scotch,93,370,101 to 500 Dollars,"By far the softest and gentlest of the range, and oh so drinkable. Hard to believe that this whisky is 40 years old, actually, as it shows no sign of excessive oak. Instead, there are soothing layers of caramel and toffee as the whisky’s foundation. Add orange marmalade and other juicy citrus fruits, cinnamon spice, graham cracker, and lightly toasted almond. A gentle, subtly sophisticated Dalmore, and an interesting comparison to the much different, more visceral 50 year old. If I were a rich man, I could drink this whisky every day — it’s so easy-going.",
"Highland Park 1968 vintage, 45.6%",Single Malt Scotch,93,3657,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Well-structured and masculine with its rich malty backbone and mouth-coating fruit. Yet, there’s a silky, seductive underbelly that’s very compelling. Notes of sultana, honey-drenched mandarin, ripe peach, thick toffee, and anise, with a peppering of spice throughout, especially toward the finish, where a hint of smoke emerges. The grain whisky enhances the blend’s allure by cutting through the whisky’s viscosity, making it very more-ish. I love the combination of drinkability, flavor, complexity, and balance in this blend. Very versatile. Single malt drinkers will thoroughly enjoy this experience. (Note: at this time, this whisky is not sold in the U.S.)
",
"GlenDronach 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"Port Ellen whiskies are just going to keep getting rarer and more expensive. This old-fashioned whisky is beginning to show its age, but is still holding up nicely. It’s clean, with no excessive oak, and a soft, sweet maltiness for balance. Earthy and rooty at times, with tarry rope, beach pebbles, leafy smoke, bourbon barrel char, black licorice, lemon peel, and hints of shellfish and diesel fumes (like following a boat in the ocean). Long, smoky, lightly briny finish.",
"Royal Salute Stone of Destiny, 38 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,600,501 to 1000 Dollars,"A marriage of eight casks (seven hogsheads, one sherry butt). A whisky in excellent shape for its age. Very clean and bright on the palate, with no excessive oak. Notes of lemon tart, clementine, plum, honeyed vanilla, and polished oak, peppered with clove, soft mint, marshmallow, and subtle toasted coconut. Clinging, mouth-coating finish.  £2,250",
"Laphroaig Càirdeas Port & Wine Casks (2020 Release), 52%",Single Malt Scotch,92,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"The nose is rich but not heavy, showing applesauce, poached pears, grape jelly, raisin scones, nutty dark chocolate, and a hint of orange. Zingy with citrus oil, especially lemon, on the palate, though that’s tempered by oak, raisins, toasted nuts, dark chocolate, and leather. It finishes with more nuts, coffee bean, pipe tobacco, and persistent lemon oil; a final note of poached pear recalls the nose. Elegant. (246 bottles; U.S. exclusive)",
"Port Ellen 31 year old, 54.6%",Single Malt Scotch,93,455,101 to 500 Dollars,"The last new Chivas release was the 25 year old several years back. To be honest, I didn’t like it as much as Chivas 18 year old. Those extra years contributed an additional dry oak influence which I felt was a bit too dominant—especially on the finish. So you can imagine my concerns before tasting this 38 year old whisky. But this new Royal Salute has something to balance the dry oak that the 25 year old didn’t—lush, rich, sweet sherry notes. It’s quite fruity, with toffee apple, date nut cake, fig, molasses, and golden raisin up front, evolving to dried fruit, pencil shavings, tobacco, and polished leather, with subtle cinnamon and cocoa on the finish. My favorite of the entire Chivas line is the 18 year old (which I rated a 95) for its impeccable balance, but this is still a very impressive whisky!",
"Glenmorangie Pride 1981, 56.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,2850,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Made from whisky aged in second fill American oak sherry casks, distilled between 1973 to 1987. Richly malty, with honeyed citrus, juicy oak, chocolate fudge, and nougat. More subtle floral notes, licorice (red and black), ginger, and chamomile tea. Polished oak on the finish balances the sweetness. A great whisky to honor a great whisky maker! (Only 200 bottles for the U.S.)",
"Convalmore 1977 28 year old, 57.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,248,101 to 500 Dollars,"Now the one that peat freaks wait patiently for every year, which makes it the bottling that produces the most debate. For me, this is up there with last year’s bottling, which itself ushered in a return to high standards after a slight dropping-off in expressiveness.
This is different, however. Yes, the color is as pale as ever — has anyone ever tasted an over-oaked Port Ellen? — and yes, the nose initially shows all of the distillery’s austere notes: think of a wet fish counter and the sensation of the sea rather than overt ‘fishiness,’ while there’s also a chilled cucumber note. The difference is the sweetness, which is more to the fore, and also, it would seem, a slight dropping-off in massive smokiness. Here the peat is integrated into the whole.
The palate has a numb spot right on the front, then wasabi-like heat coupled with olive oil. Soon the sea rolls in and it stands there like some creature from the Black Lagoon covered with balls of tar, draped in wet seaweed, encrusted with barnacles and clams — and clutching a kipper. But don’t forget the sweetness that spreads across the tongue and slowly drifts into fresh spice and antiseptic. Complex…and there’s a scant 3,000 bottled for the globe. [not available in the U.S.] £280",
"The Dalmore 1978, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,750,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Glenmorangie Pride employs the use of Sauternes barriques to give a 10 year period of secondary maturation to a batch of spirit distilled in 1981. The result is a whisky with an intense, pungent, earthy nose; very complex, with polished old furniture notes, spices, oak tannins, and licorice. The palate is ‘full on’ for a Glenmorangie; waxy, with sherbet, honey, and baked apple, then orange marmalade, sultana, and a hint of smoke in the lengthy finish. Available July 1, 2011. Price is approximate.",
"Lagavulin 1993 Islay Jazz Festival bottling (2011 Release), 55.4%",Single Malt Scotch,93,127,101 to 500 Dollars,"OK, confession time. This remains one of my favorite whiskies ever, a classic example of what long, slow aging in a refill cask can do for a whisky — increase its unctuous nature, bring out butterscotch, ginseng, honey, deepen the orchard fruits, and release a dazzling spiciness on the tongue. It has balance, it has finesse, and there’s not much left. £155(Not available in the U.S.)",
"The Whisky Exchange Masterpieces Range 18 year old 1990 vintage (distilled at Bowmore), 61.6%",Single Malt Scotch,93,191,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 1978 vintage release from The Dalmore has been ‘finished’ for two years in Matusalem sherry casks from Gonzalez Byass, following 29 years in American white oak. Just 477 bottles are available. Freshly-ground coffee, marzipan, dark berries, and rich sherry on the smooth nose, with milk chocolate and Jaffa oranges. Smokier with water. Citrus fruits and more milk chocolate on the rich, full palate, plus roasted almonds. Long and juicy in the finish, with aniseed and fruit pastilles.",
"Glenfarclas Family Cask 1972 (Cask #3551), 44.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,599,501 to 1000 Dollars,"An extremely limited edition issued at last year’s Islay Jazz Fest, this was chosen by warehouseman Iain McArthur as a prime example of a ‘bodega’ sherry butt (see page XX for more on the ‘bodega’ process). It is, simply, massive, with concentrated soy/balsamic notes combining with hot embers, burning rosemary, fig, coffee, and candied peels. The smokiness is unrestrained on the tongue; all soot, earth, and a rolling wave of deep, pimento-accented meatiness leading to a kippery finish. Magnificent. (Distillery only) £80",
"Diamond Jubilee by John Walker & Sons, 42.5%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,157000,10001 and above,"Bowmore lovers rarely get excited about the smokiness of their favorite single malt. Rather, they obsess about the tropical fruits that some old bottlings exhibit. Here is one such example. Initially the nose suggests verjus and linseed oil, but then peachiness rather than beachiness emerges. The smoke hits first on the tongue, backed up with mango and violet, then the tropical elements and the smoke play off each other up until a guava-laden finish.",
"Glenfarclas 1953, 47.2%",Single Malt Scotch,93,9420,5001 to 10000 Dollars,"Dark amber in hue, this shows immediate mature elegance with great sweetness — think of spiced honey or mead. There are some light notes of pecan pie and all the while that thread of the sod. Glenfarclas can never fully escape its dark roots. There’s dried peach and fruit leather, toffee, and, with water, biscuits dunked in tea. The palate is autumnal and soft — fruit compote and peppermint. This is what you want from fully mature Glenfarclas at its peak. (U.S. exclusive).",
"Compass Box Oak Cross, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Bright gold. Amazingly fresh fruits and quince, slowly evolving into mango, blueberry, and a jammy tayberry note. At the same time, exotic spices like cardamom begin to build, particularly when the surface is broken with a drop of water, while vanilla pod notes develop. In the mouth, the grain smooths all the elements, giving an unctuous feel. There’s just sufficient oakiness to give structure and any smoke is far in the distance.  A triumph of the blender’s art. £100,000",
"Douglas Laing Big Peat Christmas 2013, 54.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,76,0 to 100 Dollars,"The hits just keep on coming for Glenfarclas. Here we see it not only with enormous age but in relaxed mode in terms of oak. You can tell it’s old: the leathery waxiness and exotic fruits of whisky rancio; you can tell it’s Glenfarclas because of the ever-present earthiness, but both are intensified into a new aromatic realm: gentlemen’s barbershop, rowan berry, and images of an old bonfire next to a gingerbread house. Mysterious, subtle, and highly complex. £5,995",
"Cragganmore Triple Matured Edition, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,93,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"This has long been a core whisky for Compass Box, but the latest version of it is spicier and fresher than I recall, and without doubt, it's my new best friend. Virgin French oak heads help to contribute oriental and aromatic spices on the nose, with hints of melon and pineapple candy sweets. The taste is a delight, with spearmint, soft toffee, sweet citrus fruit, lemonade mixed with beer, and strawberry wafers. An array of spices from cinnamon to chili to ginger dominate the finish.",
"Mortlach 18 year old, 43.4%",Single Malt Scotch,93,304,101 to 500 Dollars,"Launched a few years ago with a Dr. Haddock-like cartoon figure on the label, Big Peat does just what it suggests it does…and then some. It's a mix of Islay peated malts and includes some Port Ellen, but don't get distracted by that. Instead, indulge yourself in the biggest, peatiest, oiliest, earthiest, grungiest, gunkiest slab of industrial malt this side of a leaky steam engine. This whisky just gets better and better.",
"Johnnie Walker Odyssey, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,1100,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Bottled for Friends of the Classic Malts (which means most of you), this is Cragganmore in early autumnal guise. Dry leaves underfoot, ripe black fruits on the bushes, waxed jacket, chestnut, and a whiff of cedary smoke, opening into dried peach. The palate is thickly textured, with those fruits, dark chocolate, and pomegranate molasses. The immensely long finish gives you light pepper, smoke, and blackberry jam. Cragganmore at its very best, and at a great price. £80",
"Lagavulin 1995 Feis Ile (2014 Release), 54.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,167,101 to 500 Dollars,"Deep amber in color with the green glints of first-fill sherry, this has bosky notes and meat—mutton and venison—plus graphite, bitter chocolate, and wet rock before layers of dried stone fruits and date. This is the most savory and Bovril-like of the new range. The palate is feral and earthy; think mushroom with game pie, and rowan berries. Deep, but with more dimensions than the previous 16 year old which, in comparison, seems like a blunt instrument. £180/500 ml",
"Exclusive Malts Speyside 25 year old 1989 Cask #3,942, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,93,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Jim Beveridge delivered these aromas of toffee apple, peach, and rich berry fruits by working with European oak casks. The smoke is timid, with hints of background salinity. The finely structured mouthfeel is where this triple malt whisky truly shines: the polished smoothness is exceptional. The flavor journey begins with honey, citrus, and swirling melted chocolate, building to a fire of squeezed orange oils, dry fruits, and pecan nuttiness before concluding with rich espresso, dark caramels, and plain chocolate. Immaculate.",
"Port Ellen 1978 35 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 56.5%",Single Malt Scotch,93,3300,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"A sherry-cask Lagavulin, this immediately shows a rich, mellow power with a touch of potter’s wheel, but it needs water to bring out sandalwood, beach bonfire, kombu, Lapsang Souchong, and bog myrtle. The palate is where it shows itself fully; resinous and thick, unctuous even, with that scented pine/juniper tea note shifting into paprika-rubbed ham, membrillo, currants, blackberry. I’ve a feeling that this period will be seen as Lagavulin’s golden age. £99",
"Mackillop’s Choice (distilled at Mortlach) 1991, 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,93,290,101 to 500 Dollars,"Exclusive Malts doesn't disclose the source distillery, which doesn't matter when you’ve got a whisky that’s a gem. Apple cider defines the nose and is complemented by ginger and iris. On the palate this whisky is lush but well balanced, with honeyed apple cider, gingerbread cookie, and baked apple. In the center of all this is rancio. Ginger spice and baked apple define the finish, which is long and flavorful. Great balance, integration, and flavor. What more can you ask for? (U.S. only)",
"The Scotch Malt Whisky Society Pigs in Plaster 14 year old (#4.1980), 59.1%",Single Malt Scotch,93,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"Scarcity and the secondary market have driven prices up, so either buddy-up to a rich guy, or club together to try this. Greater levels of cask interaction have added an extra dimension to a whisky that is often skeletal. The smoke’s in the background, as salted cashew, peppermint, tansy, furniture polish, and smoked meats take center stage. The palate is slowly expanding and smoked, with some chocolate and wax. Finally, a Port Ellen that is truly, classically mature. A killer. (2,964 bottles)",
"Dailuaine 1980 34 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015), 50.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,2000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Full gold. Weighty, but not oppressed by wood. Full, rich rancio aroma, which brings to mind an ancient cognac. It is rich and powerful, but has great finesse and perfect balance: cooked fruit, some spice, a lot of waxiness, licorice…and then the distillery’s signature meatiness. The palate starts sweetly with ripe old autumn fruits, and soft tannins. This has everything you want from a mature whisky, and from Mortlach, with added elegance. Highly recommended. £198",
"Brora 37 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2015), 50.4%",Single Malt Scotch,93,1925,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"This single cask, distilled at Highland Park, is an excellent example of why distilleries sell off certain casks. On the nose it’s Highland Park's signature sherry and peat, but on the palate it's a beast. Monster peat smoke surfs on a lush layer of berry and malt. This builds to a peak with smoke, salt, and oak spice, bolstered by the high proof. A smoky, dry finish rounds off a monster whisky, different from Highland Park's style, but very interesting. (Julio’s Liquors only)",
"Compass Box Flaming Heart 2015 Edition 15th Anniversary, 48.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"That rarely-spotted beast Dailuaine gets the Special Release treatment. This example has come from refill American oak and has immediate marzipan notes on top of the distillery’s fascinating mix of meaty density and sweetness. In time there are fat fruits, Victoria plum, bitter citrus, faded green leafiness, and chocolate notes. The palate is ripe, rich, and profound, with a hint of tropical fruits cut with cacao. Long, elegant, and complex, this is the best of this year’s bunch for me.",
"John Walker & Sons Private Collection 2016 Edition, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,850,501 to 1000 Dollars,"An old Special Releases favorite, this is the fourteenth such Brora bottling. Distilled in 1977 and matured in refill American oak hogsheads, it is the oldest Brora issued by Diageo to date. 2,976 bottles have been released. Leather, ginger, and stewed fruits on the nose, with smoky, dusty aromas. Lighter and fresher than previous veteran releases, with cooking apples, cinnamon, fudge, dried grass, and light peat on the palate. Sweet notes fade, leaving earthy, savory smoke in the long finish.",
"Port Ellen 37 year old, 55.2%",Single Malt Scotch,93,4000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Without dredging up all the brouhaha over the particulars of the component malts, this exemplary whisky has a balance you could rest on a pinhead. Earthy peats, discarded fish boxes, and crisp bacon rind combine in a smokiness you can really get into, while there is honey sweetness, macadamia nuts, and a bouquet of early summer flowers. It dances upon the tongue, sweet with toasted spices, anchored by dark citrus, and with a telling waxiness to the mouthfeel. Get some.",
"Brora 38 year old, 48.6%",Single Malt Scotch,93,2200,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Here’s your private audience with the inestimable Mr. Beveridge. After contemplating impeccably selected aged liquids from the big five Distillers Company Limited (DCL) grain distilleries, he’s ready. Three vattings representing cask character, distillery character, and Highland single malt were combined in the final blend. Fresh layers of lemon and honey mingle with wood smoke. A seductive soft and creamy palate, saturated with fudge and delicate vanilla fuse together in a study of honeyed perfection. A fine indulgence. The best yet. (8,888 bottles)",
"Lagavulin 25 year old, 50.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,1200,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"The sixteenth Special Releases Port Ellen is the oldest to date. Initially, sea breeze on the nose, brine, rock pools, and gentle iodine, followed by dried fruits, peat, and wood polish. Full-bodied, very silky, again with brine to the fore, plus sweet peat, drying slowly, ginger, black pepper, and balancing tropical fruit notes. The finish is long, with burnt oak embers and licorice. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (2,900 bottles)",
"Royal Salute 32 year old Union of the Crowns, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,380,101 to 500 Dollars,"Another Special Releases staple, this is the fifteenth and oldest Brora in the series to date. The nose offers hemp, oiled brown paper, lemon juice, ashy peat, and sweetening malt. The oily palate boasts sweet fruit notes, peaty toffee, and ginger. Long in the softly smoky finish, with black pepper, plain chocolate, char, and licorice. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (2,984 bottles)",
"Sheep Dip Islay Blended Malt, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"This cask strength, sherry cask matured expression was released as part of Lagavulin’s bicentennial celebration. The nose offers new leather, tropical fruits, brittle toffee, and brine, backed by spicy peat smoke. Smoky sherry notes open up in time. The rich, well-mannered palate boasts sweet peat, brine, muted sherry, figs, gentle spices, tangerines, and lemons. Becoming more savory in the long, gently smoky, malty finish. Very drinkable at cask strength. A great Lagavulin. (8,000 bottles)",
"Compass Box Spice Tree Extravaganza, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"Containing some precious closed distillery stocks, this feels like the height of luxury with its aromas of clove-studded oranges, cinnamon sticks, rich chocolate, and caramels.

(Global Travel Retail only)",
"GlenDronach 21 year old Parliament, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,93,262,101 to 500 Dollars,"There has been an excellent streak of Islay blended malts recently, and here is another worthy contender from the Spencerfield Spirit Company. This one offers the sizzle of bacon fat, thick clods of peat, cocoa, and breezy smoke. The rounded palate has sweet satsuma, spice, generous malty notes, and burnt caramel. The wafting smoke builds until it engulfs the back of the palate. You will be wanting one of these.",
"The Last Drop 50 year old Double Matured, 51.8%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,4500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Recognizably Spice Tree, but it’s richer, more dapper, traveling in style, and wearing better shoes. Peanut brittle, toasted coconut, and pale, light sherry. Honeyed palate with caramelized sugar, red apple, and red berry fruit before the gingersnaps and clove bite. It revs up with another spicy blast for the finish. A tasty fifth Tenth Anniversary bottling from Compass Box; just don’t let yesterday take up too much of today. (12,240 bottles)",
"Exclusive Blend 1993 23 year old, 50%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,145,101 to 500 Dollars,"Part of the core range from GlenDronach, Parliament has been aged in a mix of oloroso and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks and is non-chill filtered.

"Glen Moray 25 year old Port Cask Finish, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"TLD’s sixth release captivates with dark caramel, Brazil nut, polished oak, cacao, scorched earth, grilled field mushroom, and roasted coffee bean aromas. To sip is to submit to a discombobulating whirl of cherry and jellied black fruits replete with old sherry characteristics, replaced by an unctuous, oily base, torn asunder by seething spices of clove, pepper, and star anise. Ever-changing. Muted exit of dulled spice, browning apple, and eucalyptus. (898 bottles)",
"Compass Box The Double Single 2017 Release, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,175,101 to 500 Dollars,"You are missing a trick if you don’t snap up these small batch blended malts when you see them. Savory beef juices, black fruits, particularly black currant, loose Keemun tea, and dense oak characteristics. Sweet baked orange with notable alcohols initially, then tangy with caramelized brown sugar, butterscotch, dark rum, Brazil nut, pepper, cacao, and black currant puree. With water, it tastes deliciously of chocolate. A serious heavyweight whisky.",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Glenturret) 35 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,93,173,101 to 500 Dollars,"Distilled in 1988 and finished for an unspecified period in port casks after lengthy maturation in bourbon barrels. Floral, perfumed, and very enticing on the nose. Vanilla fudge, cocktail cherries, polished oak, and gentle spices. Soft and sweet on the palate, with vanilla, overripe orange, cinnamon, and milky coffee. Long and slightly peppery on the finish, with persistent drying fruitiness. Complex and extremely accomplished.",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company 29 year old (distilled at Macallan), 43.5%",Single Malt Scotch,93,560,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Not seen since 2010, this yields vanilla frosting, menthol, spearmint, cream, dry spices, cedarwood, chopped herbs, and a discernable whiff of old grain. Silky taste of butterscotch; it becomes more honeyed, with creamy vanilla, dried banana, malt, and a pinch of cinnamon, pepper, herbs, clove, and eucalyptus. The yin and yang of Glen Elgin and Girvan makes an admirable exercise in precision, minimalist blending. Mad as a box of frogs.",
"Port Ellen 37 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 51%",Single Malt Scotch,93,3500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Sherry cask matured in its entirety, this rich, southern Highland beauty exudes a perfume of deep orange, sweet cherry, plum, nutty fruitcake, and pleasant oak.

"Brora 34 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 51.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,1700,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"This has the poise and physique of a classic sherried Macallan. Hazelnut, mixed peel, peach cobbler, and wood spices form a delightful olfactory combination. Warm, weighty sherry notes bathe the mouth with ginger loaf, milk chocolate chunks, and espresso in support, lilting toward a lip-smacking finish of peach melba and amontillado sherry. It’s increasingly rare to find a top-quality aged independent Macallan, so don’t miss out.",
"The Last Drop 1971, 47.2%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,4000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"This 1979 vintage is the 17th Special Releases Port Ellen. It has been aged in refill American oak hogsheads and butts.

"Bruichladdich 1984, 43.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,1100,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Distilled in 1982, this expression was matured in refill American oak hogsheads.

A relatively restrained Brora. (3,000 bottles)",
"Dewar’s 25 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,225,101 to 500 Dollars,"This veteran Dalmore was matured successively in bourbon casks, Matusalem oloroso sherry casks, colheita port pipes, more bourbon wood, and finally, Champagne casks.

"Big Peat 25 year old, 52.1%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,236,101 to 500 Dollars,"It’s like someone just turned up the volume on flavor.

and malted barley as it softens to a beautiful velvety texture. This whisky’s great journey
is over. The baked apricot instigates an eternal finish (1,352 bottles, 300 for the U.S.)",

"Laphroaig Triple Wood, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,93,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Aged in a European oak oloroso sherry hogshead. Orange marmalade and lanolin on the nose, with caramel and candle wax dripped onto old leather. Full-bodied, with slightly bitter orange notes, plus nutmeg and aniseed on the palate.

"The Dalmore 45 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,93,12500,10001 and above,"Aged for a quarter century and finished in Royal Brackla casks? Count me in. The nose is highly attractive; a rich maltiness unfolds with vanilla oak, flapjacks, whole almonds, and gentle background spices.

The mellow, sweet smoke makes all your cares drift away. It’s like walking on an Islay beach through seaweed stranded at the high-tide mark. Lemon lozenges, Sweethearts, flashes of citrus, stewed apple, and growing smoke. The gentle, glossy, mouth-coating finish generates an urge to expertly puff smoke rings out through pursed lips.

"Port Askaig 33 year old single cask, 50.3%",Single Malt Scotch,93,800,501 to 1000 Dollars,"A beguiling nose of raisins, dried figs, hazelnuts, white chocolate, brown sugar, and candied ginger, with a rich meatiness that calls to mind braised pork with stewed plums. The palate sings with classic sherry flavors: figs, almonds, hazelnuts, dark chocolate, white pepper, orange peel, and a lithe minerality. As might be expected given the ABV, water may be added with impunity. From an undisclosed Highland distillery, matured in a modified solera system and finished in a PX cask.

"GlenDronach Grandeur 27 year old (Batch 10), 50.1%",Single Malt Scotch,93,580,501 to 1000 Dollars,"A turbocharged version of the formidable standard 10 year old, Cask Strength varies in ABV from batch to batch. Tar and antiseptic hit the nose immediately, along with peat smoke, malt, newsprint, and new leather. There’s also lemon, vanilla, and brine.

"Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection 1954 (distilled at Glenlivet), 41%",Single Malt Scotch,93,15000,10001 and above,"Bottling at cask strength, with only ‘barrier filtering’ to remove particles of char, rather than the standard chill-filtration process, gives the whisky greater integrity, with heightened aromas and flavors, and a satisfyingly sinewy mouthfeel not found in the standard 10 year old. Classic ‘burning hospital’ notes feature on the nose, along with peaty malt, vanilla, lemon, and brine. Charcuterie and cocoa powder add to the effect on the palate, before phenolic, medicinal, and sweet malt notes bring things to a close.

"GlenDronach 27 year old Grandeur (Batch 10), 50.1%",Single Malt Scotch,93,700,501 to 1000 Dollars,"After many limited releases, we finally have a permanent age-statement expression of Port Charlotte, with a satisfying number of years under its belt. Distilled from Scottish-grown barley, it is matured predominantly in first-fill American oak casks, along with second-fill American and second-fill French wine casks. It is peated to 40ppm, in line with other Islay heavy-hitters, but the peat is never a blunt instrument, retaining sufficient restraint to allow other characteristics—maritime notes, the sweetness of caramel, coconut, and orchard fruits—to shine through. Number 4 in the 2018 Top 20 
",
"Kilchoman STR Cask-Matured (2019 Release), 50%",Single Malt Scotch,93,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Historically used for blending, Tamdhu flies under the radar of many scotch aficionados. But this underappreciated Speyside whisky compares well with more famous sherry bombs by offering a sweet, savory, slightly funky depth. At first sniff, Tamdhu seems like it might knock you out with one blow—but this gentle giant is a lover, not a fighter. Viscous and meaty, this cask-strength stunner reveals dried fruit, dark chocolate ganache, ginger spice, and saline minerality, thundering softly into a long finish. Ian Macleod Distillers revived Tamdhu, and their pledge to bring Rosebank back to life excites us to rediscover more top-quality whisky with a distinct identity. Number 8 in the 2017 Top 20 
",
"Glen Scotia 2003 Campbeltown Malts Festival Rum Cask Finished (2019 Release), 51.3%",Single Malt Scotch,93,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"Following the Spice Tree recipe of 60% Clynelish, 20% Dailuaine, and 20% Teaninich, Extravaganza’s core was matured for more than four additional years in light/medium toast, refill, and heavy toast hybrid casks of American and French oak. Finally, sherry-matured Glen Ord, Benrinnes, and Allt-a-Bhainne were added to the mix. The elaborate process is typical of maverick blender John Glaser, but it’s his results that count. Flavors of peanut brittle, toasted coconut, and pale, light sherry translate into a delicious honeyed palate of caramelized sugar, red apple, and red berry fruit. Ginger and clove provide further rigor before a finish of incendiary spices. Number 7 in the 2017 Top 20

"Johnnie Walker Ghost and Rare Glenury Royal Edition, 43.8%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,350,101 to 500 Dollars,"Ardbeg doles out occasional limited releases for their avid fans, but for nearly a decade the core range consisted of just three whiskies: 10 year old, Uigeadail, and Corryvreckan. The addition of An Oa, matured in a combination of virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez sherry, and bourbon barrels, and married in a French oak ‘gathering vat’ prior to bottling, marks a reason to celebrate. An Oa is a more approachable Ardbeg. It lacks some of the typical oiliness, but flavor and complexity abound with hot peat, black tea, and peppery cloves. Die-hard Ardbeg fans should have no complaints, and new converts have a real treat in store. Number 6 in the 2017 Top 20

"Balvenie 26 year old A Day of Dark Barley, 47.8%",Single Malt Scotch,93,800,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The oldest in the quintet of expressions in the Glenrothes Soleo Collection, this was matured predominantly in first-fill sherry casks. The nose offers pineapple, mango, malt, and nutmeg. Richly sherried on the muscular palate, with caramel, citrus fruits, licorice, and wood tannins. The finish is long and drying, with sherry-soaked old oak. Glenrothes at its very best.",
"Aberlour A’bunadh Alba Cask Strength (Batch #001), 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,93,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"The nose yields baked apples, cherry blossom, marzipan, then blackcurrant cordial and a hint of coal smoke. The palate features cocktail cherries, sponge cake, faint sherry, plus prunes and raisins. The finish is very long; tannic, with musty black pepper. (50 Bottles in U.S.)",
"Glenlivet Enigma, 60.6%",Single Malt Scotch,93,149,101 to 500 Dollars,"The tenth limited release of Grandeur was matured in a mix of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks. It offers a nose of ginger, raisins, old leather, smoky orange, blackcurrants, and walnuts. The palate is voluptuous, with full sherry notes, figs, dates, cinnamon, and cloves. Licorice and spicy dark chocolate in the lingering finish. (240 bottles for the U.S.)",
"Laphroaig 16 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,93,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"This was distilled in 2012 and matured in 43 red wine casks that had been shaved, toasted, and recharred, hence ‘STR.’ The nose offers rich, creamy, medicinal peat, sea salt, vanilla, and loganberries. Sweet berry notes and caramel on the slick palate, then peat gathers momentum, with cinnamon and tangy citrus fruits. The finish features barbecue smoke, chili, and black pepper. (1,920 bottles for the U.S.)",
"The Last Drop 56 year old, 47.2%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,4350,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"The nose has sweet smoke and more prominent aromas of banana, vanilla, guava, papaya, jasmine, hibiscus, and citrus oil, with some salinity and chalky minerality. The palate is consistent: intense tropical fruit—guava, mango, coconut—plus hazelnut, smoked almonds, milk chocolate, and salty kelp. It finishes with smoked nuts, toasted tobacco, chalky minerality, dry oak, and persistent fruitiness. Lots to unpack here, and it develops beautifully with water—take your time.",
"Glenlivet Enigma, 60.6%",Single Malt Scotch,93,149,101 to 500 Dollars,"This presents a mellow bouquet of rich dried fruits, peat smoke, baked sugar on puff pastry, and almond butter cups. The chocolate-orange signature note ebbs and flows, mingling with spices and clove, nuts, dried apricot, caramel, vanilla, and baked apple, ending with a frisson of spice and mild smoke. Understated elegance: this whisky is polished smooth as glass.",

Classic Balvenie honey and fruit spices on the nose, with light oiliness, ginger, and orange blossom. Rich flavors of canned pears and pineapple in syrup on the palate, with hot chocolate and wood spices. Marzipan, dark chocolate, and black pepper in the long finish. A delightfully different Balvenie. (150 bottles)",
"Aberlour A’bunadh Alba Cask Strength (Batch #001), 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,93,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"The yin to Aberlour A’bunadh’s yang, this cask-strength single malt is matured entirely in bourbon casks rather than sherry. The result is a bracingly pure whisky with deceptive simplicity; its flavors are clean and its structure precise, but it’s far from boring. The nose recalls black-and-white cookies, vanilla-frosted yellow cake, and shortbread with caramel topping, along with honeysuckle, jasmine, and coconut cream. Mouth-coating and full, it has flavors of poached pear, malt balls, nougat, lemon curd, toasted coconut, and hints of spice. Vanilla, chocolate, and nut flavors are almost endless on the finish. Add water, or don’t: this is delicious either way. Number 5 in the 2019 Top 20",
"Mortlach 26 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2019), 53.3%",Single Malt Scotch,93,2000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"A riddle inside a bottle, this release follows Glenlivet’s previous mystery series bottlings Alpha, Cipher, and Code. Packaged in a jet-black bottle and box that look part Arthur C. Clarke monolith and part 3-D cryptic crossword puzzle, it’s devoid of cask information or tasting notes by design. The best solution is to open it and unlock the whisky’s secrets. Classic Glenlivet notes of lemon curd, melon, fresh peaches, bitter orange, and baked apples on the nose, followed by a smooth, creamy palate of marshmallow, toasted almond, marzipan, and lemon iced tea. The long, vibrant finish is replete with crème brûlée, sultana, cinnamon, and tropical fruit. Number 8 in the 2019 Top 20 ",
"Pittyvaich 29 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2019), 51.4%",Single Malt Scotch,93,430,101 to 500 Dollars,"This expression has been matured entirely in first-fill bourbon casks.

"Lagavulin 16 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"This release from independent bottler The Last Drop has a captivating aroma of dark toffee, cinnamon, Brazil nut, star anise, polished oak, vanilla seed, crème de cassis, and a wisp of smoke that shows more charred stave as time goes on. Peach and baked orange precede an early peak of spice and smoke, then sit back and swim in the soothing mélange of chocolate brownie, Whoppers, stewed apple, vanilla pod, oak, sultana, and plum jam.

"Ballantine’s 21 year old Golden Zest, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,151,101 to 500 Dollars,"Part of Glenlivet’s mystery series, the concept is to have drinkers form their impressions with no information about the whisky’s age or cask maturation, although those details will be revealed at year’s end. The nose has notes of lemon curd, melon, fresh peaches, bitter orange, and baked apples. A nimble, creamy palate offers marshmallow, toasted almond, marzipan, and lemon iced tea. The finish has length and vibrance, with crème brûlée, cinnamon, and a tropical note. A delicate, enchanting whisky.",
"Royal Salute 29 year old Pedro Ximénez Sherry Cask-Finished, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,549,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Distilled in 2011 and bottled in 2019, this is the first fully sherry-matured version of Kilchoman’s 100% Islay expression sold in the U.S., made with barley grown and malted on-site, and from a cask selected by importer ImpEx. A bold, complex nose of peat, smokehouse, dried leaves, and lime. Bitter chocolate and raisins on the palate, and a finish of blackberry coulis, chocolate, and pepper. A tour de force from this young distillery. (U.S. exclusive; 329 bottles)",
"Glenmorangie Grand Vintage Malt 1996, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,825,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Sweet and clean, with aromas of honeysuckle, confectioners’ sugar, lemon, fresh jasmine, nougat, and coconut cream. The palate is remarkably consistent, with lemon curd, toasted coconut sprinkled over oatmeal, vanilla cookie, pear, and juicy citrus. A lengthy finish of grapefruit, lemon, and apple continues the theme. The clean, spirit-driven profile might give the impression of simplicity, but the high ABV ensures there is much to unpack. (Individual reviewer rating: 92)",
"Compass Box Great King Street Glasgow Blend, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"Aged in newly toasted first-fill Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry-seasoned casks, this veteran ‘beast of Dufftown’ makes a big impression. Sweet, with smoky sherry, fragrant pipe tobacco, old leather, walnuts, vanilla, and ripe cherries. The oily palate yields more leather, blackcurrant cough drops, nutmeg, cloves, Jaffa oranges, and black tea. Raisins, licorice, and oak tannins, before sweeter chocolate in the very long finish (3,883 bottles; 276 for the U.S.)",
"Ballantine’s 23 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,185,101 to 500 Dollars,"Distilled in 1989 and matured first in Pedro Ximénez, then in oloroso sherry-seasoned casks. Delicate and restrained on the nose, with apple, pear drops, ginger, and malt. Initially, sweet sherry, then dark berry fruits emerge on the supple palate, with oatmeal stout. More apples, and ginger, plus prunes and chili in the long, warming finish. An excellent release from an underrated closed distillery. (4,976 bottles; 600 for the U.S.)",
"Gordon & MacPhail 125th Anniversary 1972 (Distilled at Coleburn; Cask No. 3511), 62.4%",Single Malt Scotch,93,2500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"This has been Lagavulin’s principal expression for more than 30 years. Iodine, rich peat, and caramel on the early nose, with sherry, sea salt, and charcuterie. The oily, briny palate offers peat and a medicinal note, along with black tea, Seville orange, toffee, cinnamon, and a hint of smoked fish. Peat embers and hot tar in the lengthy, spicy finish. Deeply satisfying!",
"Aberfeldy 18 year old French Red Wine Cask-Finished (Batch 2920), 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Perhaps the most alluring name ever given to a whisky, this has a nose of bright, zesty, potent clementine with vanilla sponge cake, fudge, heady floral scents, toasted coriander seeds, and peppercorn. Citrus drives the palate, but it’s sweet and tangy, and arrives with vanilla, fudge, toffee, and twinkling little flights of spice. Brilliant blending and the tastiest exploration of Ballantine’s signature notes to date. (Travel Retail exclusive)",
"Glenmorangie A Tale of Cake, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,99,0 to 100 Dollars,"This second release in the Flask Collection epitomizes deft management of PX finishing to produce an opulent treat. Honey and sherry notes, chunks of fruit-and-nut chocolate, melting caramel, plummy fruit, chocolate-covered raisins, refined dry spices, and stimulating peppercorn notes as the whisky warms.

The nose is sweet and inviting, with honey, ginger, vanilla fudge, milk chocolate, and nectarines. Very smooth on the palate: peaches in cream, more milk chocolate, caramel, then spicy apricots. Long in the finish, with orange rind and a hint of chile.",
"Talisker 8 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2020), 57.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,119,101 to 500 Dollars,"Honey, vanilla, poached pears in cream, driftwood bonfires, and a sprinkle of wood spices comprise a clean, focused, and well-balanced nose. A golden and silky palate of sweet honey, vanilla, white chocolate, and lemon zest, with plenty of body. Enter caramel; the smoke cuts to the front, outstripping aromatic spices, orchard fruit, and baked citrus flavors. Compelling and moreish: drink whenever it’s raining in Glasgow and you can’t go wrong.",
"Compass Box The Peat Monster, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"An exceptional blend from first-fill American oak casks, which has Glenburgie
whisky at its heart. Dry oak, Rolos, cantaloupe, dried mango strips, papaya, and
cinnamon on the nose. Rewarding and weighty, with caramel, orange, raspberry,
layers of spice, and dark toffee, with a concentrated fruitiness and a smear of spices
leading to a warm, dark, lengthy finish. (Travel Retail exclusive)

"Aberfeldy 18 year old French Red Wine Cask-Finished (Batch 2920), 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Perfumed on the nose, with fresh-cut flowers, canned peaches in syrup, butterscotch, and white chocolate. More canned peaches, orange peel, apple crumble, hazelnuts, and heather honey on the palate. The finish is long and peppery. Remarkably vibrant for its age. (363 bottles, 38 for U.S.)",
"Balblair 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Creamy on the nose, with malt, toasted cereal, white pepper, nutmeg, and, ultimately, mulled wine. A substantial mouthfeel, with honey, slightly smoky red wine notes, raspberry jam, and fruit spice. The finish is long, with spicy dark chocolate and warm spices that really linger. (Individual reviewer rating: 90)",
"Glenmorangie 15 year old The Cadboll Estate, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"Generous and complex on all fronts: The nose is rich with marzipan, sweet oranges, milk chocolate, pistachio ice cream, and shortbread, while the palate leans more toward savory flavors of toasted nuts, dark chocolate, leathery oak, and a bit of tobacco. But it retains the rich sweetness of its namesake, with marmalade, figs, and warming ginger and nutmeg. Like the best desserts, the lengthy finish leaves one wanting more—and with so much to unpack here, that’s a wonderful thing.",
"Macallan 15 year old Double Cask, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"Sweet woodsmoke, peat embers, Jaffa oranges, new leather, sea salt, and cigarette smoke on the nose. Orange carries over onto the robust palate, with quite pronounced smokiness, black pepper, and dark chocolate. Long and peppery in the finish, with lingering smoke and brine.",
"Compass Box, Flaming Heart, Batch #2, 48.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"The youngest of the 2020 Special Releases. Warm tar, farmyard, charcuterie, and faint iodine on the fruity nose. Peppery stewed fruits and gentle woodsmoke on the voluptuous palate. Very prickly in the long finish, with fruit-and-nut dark chocolate and chile paste. An intriguing and attractive take on Talisker.",
"Compass Box Monster, 54.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"

The much-beloved Peat Monster was recently given a new recipe designed to create greater depth and elegance. The peat influence, while still omnipresent, is now more subtle. On the nose it’s gentle and fragrant, wafting over candied citrus, lemon-frosted cake, and raspberry, along with classic peated undertones of charcoal and iodine. The palate is creamy in texture, with pleasant notes of brine, seashells, ashiness, and a floral peat influence that swirls gently around rich vanilla, tropical hints of lime, smoked meats, and generous spice. The finish offers bitter chocolate, lemon hard candy, and a bang of spice and smoke. Number 9 in the 2020 Top 20",
"Dewar’s Signature, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"

Aging scotch in a secondary cask is tricky, and tinkering with a whisky that has already achieved 18 years of age is even riskier. This well-matured Aberfeldy spent its final months in red wine casks from Bordeaux under the bold vision and deft hand of malt master Stephanie Macleod. As a result, it soars above its station. Never intrusive, the red wine finish suggests Fig Newtons and dried cherries, building upon Aberfeldy’s classic honey-vanilla profile to evoke strawberry shortcake and flavors of jam and clotted cream on a fresh-baked scone. A complex, mature, and moreish whisky at an excellent price. Number 10 in the 2020 Top 20",
"Glenrothes, 1987 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"I feel this is by far the best whisky in the standard Auchentoshan portfolio, and it is one of the best Auchentoshans ever released. It’s delicious, nicely balanced, and with lovely depth for a Lowland whisky. Baked muffins, creamy vanilla, honey, and caramel blend nicely with delicate fruit notes (lemon, red current, strawberries). An impeccably balanced whisky. Similar to the 10 year old reviewed below, but with greater depth and a drier finish.",
"Bowmore Oloroso Sherry Cask 1964 Vintage, 42.9%",Single Malt Scotch,92,1500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"

Glenmorangie has been growing its own barley for years, but this U.S. exclusive marks the first release produced entirely from its estate-grown grain. Honeysuckle and jasmine waft over lemon curd and shortbread on the nose, while bright aromas of blueberry and lime stand out. The palate is malty and full: shortbread with tumbling fresh blueberries, toasted almonds, and gingery spice. It’s silky, rounded, and seamless into the finish, and beautifully transformed by a drop of water. Number 13 in the 2020 Top 20",
"Bruichladdich 'PC-5', 63.5%",Single Malt Scotch,92,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"

The iconic producer of lush sherried malts delivers again. Employing the same technique of marrying whiskies aged in sherry-seasoned casks of both American and European oak that landed the 12 year old in our 2017 Top 20 has resulted in a truly decadent dram—richly nutty and fruity, with dried apples, cherries, and prunes. The palate is wonderfully luscious, supple, and chewy, delivering mouth-coating waves of fruit that remain for minutes on end, before a long farewell of lingering, warming spice. Impressive and irresistibly good. Number 16 in the 2020 Top 20",
"Edradour Port Wood Finish, 1983 Vintage, Cask #04/0544, 52.9%",Single Malt Scotch,92,195,101 to 500 Dollars,"Balanced Islay whiskies combine peat smoke characteristics with a sweet foundation. They’re not one-dimensionally smoky. This whisky is an excellent example. This is a peat-laden whisky with refinement and grace. Creamy vanilla, caramel, and honey harmoniously marry with persistent -- yet controlled -- peat smoke. Crisp spice notes and dancing fruit throughout adds complexity. Well done.",
"Glenmorangie Cote de Nuits Finish 1975, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"(Exclusive to Park Ave. Liquors, New York, NY) This is a vatting of two single malts: the malty and sometimes smoky Ardmore and the always smoky and spicy Caol Ila. The whisky expresses smartly complex aromas of smoky bonfire smothered with peat, with notes of tar, olives, freshly ground pepper, and seaweed. A sweet maltiness (from the Ardmore?) binds the flavors together. On the palate, the whisky begins sweet, then the powerful peat smoke emerges, yielding to olives, peppery spices, and seaweed. The finish is long and powerful with the peat smoke again emerging and lingering on seemingly forever. A monster indeed. This whisky’s complexity demonstrates the virtues of vatting. Many smoky whiskies have nothing else going on behind the cloak of smoke. This one does.",
"Glenrothes 32 year old, 1972 Vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Johnnie Walker Blue, meet Dewar’s Signature. Signature is Dewar’s introduction into the ultra-premium blended scotch category. Like Johnnie Walker Blue, Signature bears no age statement, but I’m told that a 27 year old Aberfeldy is the heart of the blend. The first release consists only of 1,000 individually numbered bottles, and they’re only available in New York City. I’m always a little skeptical of very expensive blends that come in fancy packages. There are some very good, reasonably priced blends in the 10-20 year old range, and the expensive ones are often only marginally better, if that. But I like this whisky a whole lot better than the standard Dewar’s White Label, and it is also superior to Dewar’s 12 year old-a whisky which I find to be quite enjoyable. While maintaining the Dewar’s profile-nicely balanced-this whisky offers greater depth, maturity, and complexity without being too woody-a creamy, malty foundation makes sure of that. The whisky expresses a rich, honeyed maltiness which combines nicely with notes of golden raisins, vanilla, caramel, and crème brûlée, with just a hint of spicy oak notes for complexity. Signature is a different style when compared to Johnnie Walker Blue-it’s more elegant and bashful-but, like Blue, I put Signature on my short list of the finest blends on the market.",
"Signatory (distilled at Glenrothes), 30 year old, 1973, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,92,220,101 to 500 Dollars,"Some of the best intensely smoky, peaty Islay whiskies are balanced with a foundation of malty sweetness. This whisky is an excellent example. A sinewy malt with the classic bold notes of kiln smoke, peat, tarry rope, and coal ash. Sweeter notes of honeyed malt, ripe vanilla, chocolate fudge, and toasted marshmallow temper and sooth the palate, along with background berry confit. The smoke lingers long on the palate. Ardbeg devotees will not be disappointed.",
"Highland Park 1974 vintage 31 year old (Cask #8998), 45.4%",Single Malt Scotch,92,438,101 to 500 Dollars,"Mahogany color. Medium to full in body, and rich. Aroma and flavors are very reminiscent of the ""Black Bowmore"" releases: burnt fruit, roasted nuts, fruit cake, polished leather, wood resin, and just a teasing of smoke. There is a harmonious balance between the dry oak spices and the sweet, fruity oloroso sherry notes. Soothing finish. This whisky was distilled around the same time-and is very similar in flavor profile-as the legendary ""Black Bowmore"" whiskies released several years ago. Comparing this release with the Black Bowmore is only natural. Having tried this whisky next to the previous Black Bowmores, I can happily say that this whisky is as good as they are (although a lot more expensive). While the original Black Bowmore whiskies are a little bigger and fuller in body (especially towards the finish), this new 1964 Vintage is a tad softer, sweeter, more rounded, and more seductive. This is a very contemplative whisky-the more attention you devote to it, the more pleasure it gives you. 300 bottles.",
"Laphroaig Original Cask 10 year old, 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,92,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is a five year old expression of the more highly peated Bruichladdich whisky being referred to as Port Charlotte (named after the now-silent distillery down the road from Bruichladdich). More highly peated indeed. If you like your smoky Islay whiskies young and masculine, this one is for you. It’s like sticking your head in a peat-fired kiln. But there’s more to this whisky than massive smoke. There are underlying notes of kippers, soot, and tar. With further investigation, there are spice notes of black pepper and black licorice stick. What really makes this whisky multi-dimensional and balanced is its sweet underbelly of thick toffee, jammy fruit, and almond butter. Youthful, but not immature.",
"Murray McDavid (distilled at Linkwood) 1973, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,92,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"One of the first wood finishing efforts under Edradour’s new management. Very creamy in texture, with notes of sticky toffee, vanilla fudge, fruit cake, raisin, and burnt almonds. All this sits on a bed of dry, minty, resinous oak. The flavors dovetail nicely, with a soothing, satisfying finish. The port wood finishing adds complexity without dominating. 
",
"The Macallan 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,52,0 to 100 Dollars,"Amber color with shades of chestnut. Full, complex aromas of fruit (cherries, currants, berries), marzipan, Demerara sugar, roasted nuts, and molasses. Full in body, with flavors that deliver what its aroma promised. Satisfying finish.",
"Lagavulin Distillers' Edition 1991 Vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Deep amber color. Wonderfully complex, and nicely balanced aroma and flavor of vanilla sweetness, tarry rope, oak, toffee, seaweed, and brine. Medium to full in body, and creamy in texture, with a finish that doesn't quit.",
"The Macallan Cask Strength, 58.6%",Single Malt Scotch,92,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Glenrothes is one of those Speyside whiskies which matures very gracefully. Recent distillery bottlings (i.e. the 1979 and 1972 vintages) prove this point. This Signatory bottling also demonstrates that Glenrothes has the ability to get older and better. In this offering, the palate-coating, sticky caramel, syrupy maltiness of the whisky is rescued by firm, bold dry oak spice and lush fruit. Delicious toffee and roasted nuts longer on the finish. The 30 years in oak gives this whisky great depth, and bottling the whisky at natural cask strength ensures that the whisky is not cut off at the knees. A soothing post-prandial affair. 
",
"The Macallan 15 year old Fine Oak, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Antique gold, relatively light in color compared to the rest of the Highland Parks reviewed here. Nicely rounded on the nose and palate, and surprisingly youthful for such maturity. Mouth-coating texture. Quite fruity -- especially with some water -- with notes of honey-drenched citrus, sultana, key lime pie, and melon. Caramel and bitter chocolate notes emerge, with the chocolate and a wisp of smoke lingering on the finish. I could drink this all day and never tire of it. (Bottled for Virginia ABC)",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Mortlach), 36 year old, 1970 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"Amber with gold streaks. Its aroma and flavor is fresh, powerful, and medicinal, with notes of peat smoke, band-aids, tar, rich toffee, seaweed, and brine. Thick in body, with an almost molasses-like viscosity.",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Strathisla), 36 year old, 1967 vintage, 42.5%",Single Malt Scotch,92,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Honey gold Aroma: Subtly complex. Floral (especially roses). Honeyed vanilla sweetness. Subtle notes of bourbon and bakers chocolate. Murray McDavid (distilled at Linkwood, 1973, 46%) cont. Palate: Nicely balanced and with great depth. Again the honey and vanilla, which marries beautifully with the floral, herbal, subtly fruity notes. Almonds and dried spice on the finish.

"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Tomintoul) cask 644 1967 vintage 40 year old, 49.4%",Single Malt Scotch,92,260,101 to 500 Dollars,"Solid amber color. Flavors are seamless, silky smooth, and rich, with notes of dried fruit and flowers, toffee, subtle spices, and delicate nuts. A great after dinner malt, but universal enough to drink anytime.",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glen Grant), Cask #3480, 37 year old, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,92,336,101 to 500 Dollars,"Deep amber color. Complex aromas of lush fruit (orange, lemon, red currant) and oak spices (cinnamon, clove, and licorice). Rich, silky body. Great balance and depth of flavor, with complex fruit and wood spices similar to its aroma all wrapped in toffee and vanilla fudge. Very long, evolving, and satisfying finish.",
"Compass Box, The Peat Monster, Reserve Edition, 48.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"Deep amber color with crimson hues. Incredibly rich aromas of fruitcake, toffee, dates, roasted nuts, with a hint of cocoa powder and other spices. Rich and thick in body. On the palate, there are evolving notes of chewy toffee, ripe fruit (oranges, golden raisons), chocolate covered nuts, multigrain toast, and polished oak. Long, soothing finish.",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Strathisla), 1963, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,92,275,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is my favorite of the three. For about $20 more, you get a richer, much more complex whisky than the 10 year old, and it is more balanced than the 21 year old. This 15 is drier than the 10, with lovely floral and spice notes (cinnamon, coriander, dried orange peel, lavender, rose), balanced by honey-laced complex fruit, and a dry, dark chocolate/orange marmalade finish.",
"D&M (Distilled at Scapa), 19 year old, 1989 Vintage, 52.7%",Single Malt Scotch,92,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"Deep amber, mahogany color. Very mature and well-balanced. Notes of maple syrup on pancakes, roasted chestnuts, dates, pot still rum, burnished leather, maduro tobacco, and subtle Moroccan spice. Soft, stately finish. Older whiskies often show an exotic side to their personalities as they mellow out with age, especially if the wood influence doesn’t dominate. This is a very nice example of the genre.

"Lonach (distilled at Strathisla), 42 year old, 41.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,205,101 to 500 Dollars,"This whisky starts out rich and lush-both in aroma and on the palate, with notes of fig cake, candied fruit, and sticky toffee pudding. Citrus fruit (orange, lemon, tangerine)-a characteristic that emerges with many older whiskies-cuts through the heft and lushness of this whisky, contributing complexity, balance and drinkability. The whisky continues to evolve, serving up notes of almonds, exotic spice, and polished leather on the finish. An excellent example of what a mature, Speyside whisky should taste like. 
",
"Highland Park 'Hjarta' 12 year old, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,106,101 to 500 Dollars,"A deep, mature Tomintoul that manages to retain the elegance and drinkability found in younger Tomintoul whiskies. Roasted nuts, lush fruit, suggestions of cherry brandy and orange marmalade layered with rich fudge, toffee, and maple syrup. Soothing finish. Tomintoul can be a simple whisky at a younger age, but this one has matured into a beautifully complex dram. (Bottled for Park Avenue Liquors.) 
",
"Glenfiddich 50 year old, 46.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,16000,10001 and above,"I am amazed by how many old, sherried Glen Grant whiskies have been released to the market in the past ten years. (Did the distillery owners at the time also own sherry bodegas, or what?) Anyway, some of these have been dark, decadent, and delicious, and I’ll put this whisky in that category. Chestnut colored, with lush fruit, treacle, dark chocolate, leather, tobacco, roasted walnuts, and cherry cough syrup. A complex, well-structured whisky. 
",
"Talisker 25 year old (2009 Release), 54.8%",Single Malt Scotch,92,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Compass Box Whiskies celebrates the fifth anniversary of The Peat Monster by thinking big: bigger intensity, put into a bigger bottle. This bold whisky is packed with Islay and coastal character, showing tarry rope, brine, and a hint of seaweed, along with teasing smoked olive, anise, and mustard seed. There is some civility to the whisky: sweeter notes of vanilla wafer, baked apple, ripe peach, and cream attempt to soften the blow. Smoke and tar on the finish. Nicely done. (Price is per 1.75L.) 
",
"Sheep Dip 'Old Hebridean,' 1990 vintage, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Some of these old G&M Strathisla whiskies are quite lovely, and this is one of them. It’s gently sherried, soothingly oily in texture, and complex, with notes of maple syrup, candied fruit, plum, roasted nuts, polished leather, and old oak, along with some damp earth, coffee bean, cinnamon, mint, and subtle, teasing kiln smoke. It’s soft, rounded, and still holds up nicely for a 44 year old whisky. If you like old, sherried Speysiders that aren’t overly oaked or sherried, you’ll like this one. If only it was bottled at 43% or 46% (or at natural cask strength, if it was less than 43%). It would give the whisky a little more backbone, and I might have bumped my rating up to the mid-90s. 
",
"Kilchoman 'Inaugural Release,' 46%",Single Malt Scotch,92,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"This single cask bottling of Scapa is a beauty! Brilliant gold color. Clean and fresh on the nose and palate, with complex bright fruit (peach, tangerine, golden delicious apple, honeydew melon, pineapple), spice (cinnamon, vanilla, subtle cocoa), appetizing brine, and beach pebbles, all on a bed of creamy, squeaky-clean honeyed malt. Dynamic, appetizing, briny, dried spice finish. A delicious, superbly balanced whisky that makes a great aperitif, but I could drink this any time. (Bottled exclusively for D&M Aficionado’s Club.)",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glenlivet) 1987 vintage 22 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,92,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"I wish the owners of Strathisla would put out older expressions of their whisky, and here’s why. Layers of sweetness (caramel in particular, but also honey and toffee) dovetail beautifully with an array of lush fruit (orange, apricot, golden raisin, fruit gumdrops). All this is underpinned by subtle dried spice (cinnamon, cool mint, nutmeg) and teasing oak resin on the finish. What’s most impressive here isn’t the laundry list of flavors (although they certainly are there), but rather the balance. This, and its lovely depth, with no signs of lethargy. Impressive!
",
"Black Bull, 40 year old, 40.2%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"Rich, deep, and muscular on the nose and palate -- and very polished. Notes of caramel/butterscotch-coated citrus (lemon, Clementine) honeyed tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), peaches and cream, creamy vanilla, and ripe barley, along with more subtle smoke, cut grass, and ginger. Firm, dry, resinous grip on the finish keeps all the sweetness in check. Rather expensive for its age, but not for its quality. Very impressive for a 12 year old! (Available only at the Highland Park distillery, their on-line shop, and in Scandinavia.) £65",
"Highland Park “Saint Magnus,” 55%",Single Malt Scotch,92,132,101 to 500 Dollars,"We’re drinking liquid history here. Antique gold color. Aromas of dried citrus, lemongrass, and ginger with background honeyed vanilla, dried herb, bouquet of roses, and a wisp of smoke. Very long and evolving on the palate, going from sweet to dry: vanilla custard, crème brulee, white chocolate, candied citrus, juicy oak, polished leather, dried tobacco, and then resinous oak, with teasing dry roasted nuts and hint of peat bog throughout. Long dry, resinous finish. Remarkably well-maintained for its age. I can tell that it’s an old whisky, but it shows good complexity. It’s not tired and excessively oaked.
When compared to the 30 year old and 40 year old expressions, it’s actually more vibrant and youthful than the 40 sample I have. Yet it doesn’t have the deft balance and roundness which I consider a hallmark of the 30. Bottom line here: Anyone who can afford this whisky and actually drinks it will not be disappointed. It’s really nice. But for us regular folk, try to pick up a 30 year old Glenfiddich if you can find one and you won’t go wrong with the whisky — or the price (relatively speaking, that is).",
"Chieftain’s (distilled at Springbank) 40 year old, 54%",Single Malt Scotch,92,1400,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Comes across initially to me as reserved, perhaps even elegant for a Talisker. Soothing too, with an oily texture. Quite fruity (orange, tangerine, apricot), perhaps even floral, with a delicate pastry sweetness. Then the more traditional Talisker notes kick in -- brine, seaweed, warming pepper -- repeated in the finish. A high-quality Talisker; albeit a bit reserved at times. I love the oily, viscous texture.",
"Duncan Taylor 16 year old “NC2” (distilled at Aberlour), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,92,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"A marriage of Dalmore, Fettercairn, and Ardbeg, and their personalities certainly show. The whisky was blended and then aged for an additional 15 years -- very atypical. The marriage of the three really works very well, combining a rich sweetness (honeyed malt, toffee) with spice, brine, vanilla, bitter chocolate, charcoal, espresso, tobacco, cigar ash, subtle marmalade, and firm -- but not dominating -- leafy peat smoke. Thick, nicely-textured body, too. Lingering brine and smoke on the finish. Delicious as it is, I can only imagine what it would be like bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered. (I probably would be bumping it up a few points.)",
"The Dalmore, 1981 Vintage Amoroso Finish, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,92,1300,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Aged 2.5 to 3 years on bourbon casks and then finished in sherry casks for 6 months. Wow, this is quite stunning! Old-fashioned in many respects: oily texture, with rooty, layered peat smoke, coal tar, shoe polish, and hints of wet sheep as the foundation for a complex array of additional flavors: toffee apple, caramel fudge, blackberry jam, golden raisin, grist, bourbon barrel char, and licorice root. Long, smoldering ember, dried herb, light toffee finish. It’s all balanced perfectly, and very mature for its age. If you like smoky whiskies, track one down. (Not available in the U.S.) £37.00",
"Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve, 55.6%",Single Malt Scotch,92,375,101 to 500 Dollars,"Whiskies distilled at Glenlivet might be easy to find throughout the world, but this is a good thing. Take this one from Duncan Taylor—it’s delicious! It’s elegantly complex, with a tropical accent (coconut, pineapple), strawberries with whipped cream, and caramel-dipped apple. The sweetness is never heavy or cloying, and it’s balanced by lovely dried spice throughout (vanilla, ginger, soft mint, nutmeg), and especially towards the finish. Nicely done!",
"BenRiach Pedro Ximinez Finish 1995 Vintage (Cask 7165), 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,92,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"A whopping 90% malt and 10% grain whisky. Soft, with the oak remarkably restrained for its age. Soothingly sweet, with toffee apple, vanilla-spiked sponge cake, nougat, butterscotch, sultana, and cut grass. A dash of cinnamon and coconut throughout, with teasing, gentle polished oak on the finish. Deftly balanced and oh, so drinkable. ",
"Tomatin, 1973 Vintage (Cask #25602), 44%",Single Malt Scotch,92,730,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The second in a series of three high-strength, limited edition Highland Park whiskies, and a rather bold expression. Nicely sherried and noticeably smoky — more than a standard Highland Park. Quite spicy too — with cinnamon, but also ginger and nutmeg. Throw in some toffee apple, Cointreau, and waxed fruit for intrigue. Long, sherried, smoky finish. A very exciting whisky. (Not available in the U.S.)£85",
"Ardmore 100th Anniversary 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,92,155,101 to 500 Dollars,"Aged in a first-fill sherry butt. Soft sherry notes, gentle toffee, golden raisin, green tea with honey, a peppering of spice (cinnamon, red and black licorice, candied ginger, hint of coconut macaroon and brine) and undertones of juicy oak (especially on the finish). Tame, somewhat seductive, and well-rounded. Not overly oaked, and I’m not finding any off notes. A lovely whisky, but not quite as dynamic as the “classic” Springbanks I’ve tasted from the 60s.",
"Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection: Glenlivet Decades 1954, 50.6%",Single Malt Scotch,92,2050,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"This whisky packs a lot of clean, complex, and well-balanced flavors. It features a creamy, layered, malty-sweet foundation (vanilla, caramel, toffee) chock full of bright fruit (golden raisin, honeyed orchard fruit, currant), rounded out by firm, dried spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, mint) that dances on the palate. Long, warming, spicy finish. Nicely done!",
"Mackinlay’s Rare Old Highland whisky, 47.3%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,162,101 to 500 Dollars,"A seductive Dalmore. Very fruity too, with Seville orange, peaches in syrup, clementine, pineapple, and bramble. Sugared almond, powdered vanilla, ginger, and lush sherry on the finish add depth and dimension. Consistent on the nose and palate, and with great balance. I’m glad they stopped the amoroso finishing when they did. I feel that any more sherry influence here would have been counterproductive. Very lovely!",
"The Macallan Royal Wedding, 46.8%",Single Malt Scotch,92,240,101 to 500 Dollars,"A special bottling to celebrate a major distillery expansion in 2010. So nice to see this whisky bottled at cask strength and not chill-filtered. Silky smooth, velvety texture. Creamy sweet foundation of vanilla fudge and caramel-coated almond. Plenty of fruit, too (golden raisin, honeyed peach, ripe nectarine, hint of banana bread). Richly textured, good weight (but not cloying), and the flavors combine seamlessly. A celebratory whisky indeed.",
"Ardbeg Alligator, 51.2%",Single Malt Scotch,92,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is the heavily peated expression of BenRiach. (BenRiach does not differentiate their peated expressions with a different name, as Springbank does with Longrow, or Tobermory with Ledaig.) It’s also finished with the dark, lush “PX” sherry. Both influences are very evident, with the deep, heavy, earthy, smoky notes complemented by dark, fleshy, dried fruit. I think the two different influences marry very nicely here and I really enjoy drinking it. (Bottling at cask strength is a bonus!)",
"Adelphi (distilled at Linkwood) 1984 26 year old, 57.6%",Single Malt Scotch,92,148,101 to 500 Dollars,"Aged in a refill American oak cask. Quite lively for its age, and the oak (surprisingly and happily) plays a supporting role rather than dominating. Creamy and mouth-coating, with vanilla wafer, coconut cream pie, caramel, nougat, and bright fruit (sultana, apricot, tangerine, and pineapple in syrup). Soothing finish. A very nice whisky. (Not available in the U.S.)£450",
"The Balvenie Tun 1401 (Batch #2), 50.6%",Single Malt Scotch,92,263,101 to 500 Dollars,"This isn’t quite a distillery-only bottling so much as a bottle only available at the distillery — which isn’t exactly the same thing. Bottled more than 10 years ago to mark the distillery’s centenary, incredibly a small amount is still available, and it is well worth pursuing.
Until relatively recently Ardmore was an industry secret, cherished by those in the know. But the peaty and feisty no-age-statement Ardmore Traditional has introduced the malt to a new generation of drinkers, and last year’s sweet and fruity 25 year old suggested that the distillery has a potentially diverse range of future treasures to be excited about. This bottling is light, soft, sweet, and juicy. Orange flavors and peat team up to steer a middle way for what is a delicious and highly more-ish malt. Its only flaw is in the finish, which dies away too quickly for this palate. Perhaps a slightly higher strength would have improved it. No matter, it’s like the fade out of the guitar solo at the end of your favorite track; it’s a bit frustrating because you want it to go on and on, but it doesn’t stop you going back and listening to it all again.

"Port Ellen 32 year old (11th release) Special Releases 2011, 53.9%",Single Malt Scotch,92,488,101 to 500 Dollars,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. First-fill sherry wood makes a return here and adds its own rich dried fruitiness — think sultana cake — to the exotic whisky rancio notes of cheese rind, sealing wax, and roasting pheasant. As it opens, there’s fig, some peat smoke, black cherry, and concentrated stone fruits. This exotic/savory/sweet interplay continues on the tongue where there’s a surprising hint of mint and some pear blossom. The finish is long, with apple skin, gingerbread, and walnut. A discreet nod to cognac. £1,250",
"Highland Park 1971 Vintage, 46.7%",Single Malt Scotch,92,3700,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Rarely has a blend caused as much excitement as this one, but with good reason. This is also known as the Shackleton whisky, and is a recreation of the whisky abandoned in the Antarctic by explorer Ernest Shackleton more than 100 years ago. It has lemon, spring blossom, and wafts of smoke on the nose. The taste is full and citrusy, with peat and pepper in attendance. Beautifully balanced and outstanding, but there are just 50,000 bottles, so snap it up.",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glen Grant) 60 year old, 42.3%",Single Malt Scotch,92,12000,10001 and above,"Rising above the tat issued to celebrate the nuptials of Prince William and Kate Middleton was this extremely limited (1,000 bottles) release from The Macallan. The nose is a mélange of rich fruits, marzipan, and beeswax/resin but it lifts with a drop of water to show apricot and heavy florals. The palate isn’t overly grippy, with more orange peel, almond, and characteristic oiliness. A malty/nutty smooth finish makes this a great one. £150 (Not available in the U.S.)",
"Glenglassaugh 37 year old, 56%",Single Malt Scotch,92,600,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Similar to the standard Ardbeg 10 year old, except that a portion of the whisky was aged in heavily charred barrels (referred to as an “alligator” char). An aggressive whisky — even for Ardbeg — with a leathery texture throughout. Dynamic too, with coal tar, soot, bourbon barrel char, espresso, cocoa, licorice root, smoked fish, and a hint of ginger. There’s a nice creamy vanilla underbelly to balance the aggressiveness and (at least partially) muzzle the Alligator.",
"Blue Hanger 4th Release Berry Bros. & Rudd, 45.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"There are light oaked notes to start, along with Oolong tea and very subtle smoke. These then shift into a mix of cedar and scented blossom. Classic, layered elegance with the cask offering support, not dominance. The fruits have that slightly eerie quality of decay, while the palate is deep and juicy. This is an exemplary, subtle, old whisky with delicate rancio (it’s a little cognac-like), which is given a boost of extra life with a small drop of water. £94",
"Lagavulin 21 year old 2012 Special Release, 52%",Single Malt Scotch,92,624,501 to 1000 Dollars,"A vatting of selected casks located at Balvenie’s No. 24 warehouse in Dufftown, this is made up of seven ex-bourbon casks and three butts whose ages range from 1967 to 1989, all of which are then ‘married’ in a large vat (aka a ‘tun’). There’s classic Balvenie honey, along with macadamia, pistachio, and caramelized fruits. As it opens, it shifts into a high-class gentleman’s cologne: musk and sandalwood with some mulberry to add depth. Elegant and magnificent. £165",
"Talisker 35 year old Special Release 2012, 54.6%",Single Malt Scotch,92,850,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Port Ellen’s make was usually filled into old casks to maximize its smoke when used young. To us, therefore, it’s Islay’s most austere malt, yet the guys who worked there all talk of its sweetness. Here, finally, is an example of that. Yes, there’s some wet slate and briny smoke, but it’s balanced by citrus, waxy fruits, and a central sweetness adding complexity. It might have taken a long time to get here, but it was worth the wait. (Editor's Choice)   ",
"Compass Box Great King Street New York Blend, 45%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"One of two recent vintage releases, this 1971 example has been matured in seventeen Spanish oak casks, that yielded a total of 657 bottles. Sweet on the nose, with maple syrup, almonds, and sherry. Soft and insinuating. Becoming progressively smokier. Bold fruit and peat notes on the palate, plus oak, cloves, and dark chocolate notes. Peppery in the long finish, with subtle tannins and persistent citrus fruits.",
"Compass Box Flaming Heart 2012 Edition, 48.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,115,101 to 500 Dollars,"Rich gold. Superb mature nose with subtle whisky rancio, mixing fragrant mango with a little mint, rosewater, and waxiness; there’s even some custard and a whiff of woodsmoke before sandalwood brings back the exotic edge. The palate is delicate with an amazingly fresh acidity that becomes herbal (basil and tarragon). It’s late summer, when there’s a sense of the year turning, and you allow fond memories to gently wash over you. £7,800",
"Big Peat Small Batch, 53.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,48,0 to 100 Dollars,"A first-fill sherry cask bottling (one cask, exclusive to North America). Some of the old Glenglassaugh whiskies can be very delicious, and this is one of them. It's very clean, lush, and fruity (bramble, citrus, golden raisin), with a kiss of honey, toffee, and soft spice. Elegantly sherried; it’s never cloying. A very nice whisky from a quality cask that tastes more like 21 or 25 years old than 37. (I mean this in a good way.) ",
"The Exclusive Malts 22 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 1990 vintage (Cask #10866), 47.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"This Blue Hanger has sherry and fruit on the nose, but it's all reined in. Then the palate is big, rich, complex, and fruity, and late oakiness from some 30 year-plus malt in the mix brings the perfect finale. £61",
"Lagavulin Feis Ile (2013 Release, Distilled 1995), 51%",Single Malt Scotch,92,152,101 to 500 Dollars,"Lagavulin from a first-fill sherry butt? There’s unusual. This is huge, fluxing, and complex, mixing saddles and dark chocolate, pu-erh tea and smothered kiln, geranium and velvet, gamey venison and treacle. The smoke is integrated, the fires ember-like, the oak there but not oppressively so. Massive, dense, layered, and complex, this needs time to open. In short, a distillation of Islay and up alongside last year’s Jazz Festival bottling.",
"Ardbeg Ardbog, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Soft, soothing, and gentle. Layered fruit (bright orchard fruit, honeyed melon, kiwi, pineapple), polished oak, and hay, subtly spiced with vanilla bean, milk chocolate, evergreen, and cotton candy. Bottled at peak maturity. Very more-ish, too! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)",
"Talisker 1985, 56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,600,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The original Great King Street blend was all sweet lemon and spice. This is something else again. This is a gutsy, urban wise guy of a whisky, rich in peat, with distinctive malty flavors—all in all, closer to a malt than a blend. That's because of the high malt content, and only the rounded edges and soft finish are gilded by grain. Some fruit and spice emerge through the peat, but the smoke's what you remember—a master class in blending.",
"Aberfeldy 16 year old Single Cask (Cask No. 5), 57.4%",Single Malt Scotch,92,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"In my book, the bar can't be set much higher than it is for Flaming Heart and this latest version doesn't disappoint, though it does head off into a scuzzier, grittier, and more peaty direction than the 10th anniversary bottling, and has lost some of the black currant fruitiness in the process. No matter: this smolders with peaty and fishy intensity, works its way round to tinned strawberries, damson, and berry fruits, and emerges sooty and smoky. A BIG whisky.",
"Glengoyne 35 year old, 46.8%",Single Malt Scotch,92,4640,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"The original Big Peat was a mix of smoky Islay malts and was already up there with the very best competition in the category, even though many of the others were bottled at cask strength. I scored it at 90. Now it’s back to play in the big boys' pool with a killer cask strength whisky of its own. This is to whisky what AC/DC is to heavy rock: old school, predictable, but great and exactly what fans want.",
"Exclusive Malts (distilled at Longmorn) 28 year old, 51.6%",Single Malt Scotch,92,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"Clean and complex, showing a matured, somewhat restrained personality for Laphroaig: less medicinal, but more rounded. Tar, pencil shavings, anise, honeyed citrus, Spanish olive brine, and a hint of seaweed and white pepper on a bed of creamy vanilla, caramel, and light nougat. Lingering, satisfying finish. Frustrated by a dearth of 20-plus year old distillery-bottled Laphroaigs? Look no further. Delicious!",
"Signatory (distilled at Laphroaig) 1998, 60.8%",Single Malt Scotch,92,166,101 to 500 Dollars,"Though quiet to start, the impression is of a fog of smoke, balled up within a dunnage
warehouse, ready to erupt to add itself to the cool spearmint and oxidized
nuttiness. The palate is where it shows its class: mature, slowly unfolding and
layered, with Latakia tobacco, menthol, nori, white pepper, pear, and a massive,
tarry Bohea Souchong tea element on the finish. Everything from Lagavulin is
touched with gold at the moment. Try to find a bottle. (distillery only) £99",
"Glenmorangie Bacalta, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"The first release from Ailsa Bay distillery is an NAS peated single malt. The new make spirit initially spends 6 to 9 months in 24 to 100-liter Hudson Baby Bourbon casks. It’s then transferred to virgin oak, first-fill, and refill American oak casks for several years. The ultimate vatting is non-chill filtered. A sweet, smoky nose with almonds and walnuts leads into a palate featuring citrus fruit, spicy peat, and cereal notes, with cocoa and soft oak in the finish. (UK and Nordic availability) £55",
"Compass Box Peat Monster 10th Anniversary Limited Edition, 48.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 27 year old Talisker has been aged in refill American oak casks, and the nose offers brine, wood smoke, wet tarry rope, slightly medicinal, with the emergence of milk chocolate. Big-bodied, with lots of peat accompanied by chili and smoked bacon, with sweeter notes of malt, fudge, and apple. A hint of fabric Elastoplast. Long in the finish, with rock pools, bonfire ash, and sweet, tingling spice notes which carry to the very end. A powerful beast, even by Talisker standards. (3,000 bottles).",
"Glenfarclas Family Casks 1988 (Cask #434), 53.4%",Single Malt Scotch,92,580,501 to 1000 Dollars,"From a sherry cask. Bright and lively. Quite fruity, with notes of golden raisin, pineapple, nectarine, and tangerine. The fruit is balanced by honeyed malt and light caramel. A dusting of vanilla, cinnamon, and hint of cocoa, with black licorice on the finish. Lush and mouth-coating. The best of the Aberfeldy whiskies I’ve tasted to date. (New Hampshire only)",
"The Feathery, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,66,0 to 100 Dollars,"Glengoyne 35 year old has been aged in sherry casks and just 500 decanters have been released. The nose offers sweet sherry, maraschino cherries, honey, sponge cake, marzipan, and soft fudge, turning to caramel in time, with a whiff of worn leather. Slick in the mouth, with spicy dried fruit, and more marzipan and cherries. Long in the finish with plain chocolate cherry liqueur; still spicy. Finally a buttery, bourbon-like note. No negative cask connotations in this well-balanced after-dinner dram.",
"Glenfiddich Rare Oak 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,383,101 to 500 Dollars,"The nose is fascinating, as if dust is cohering into form, and fruity form at that. When it emerges there’s baked banana, fruitcake, citrus peels, passion fruit, mango, mace flower, and nutmeg. A mossy edge anchors it to earth. Even livelier with water, this is a superbly balanced, mature whisky. The palate is pure, with big retronasal impact of the spice. Layered and long, it’s at its best neat; you need the intensity to amplify all the complexity. Superb.",
"Tomintoul Reserve 37 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,600,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Any sherried Laphroaig is welcome, and this does not disappoint. Rich, resinous, medicinal, with underlying soft fruits, the smoke is all-pervading, but never dominant. In other words, it isn’t just complex and balanced, but has that other dimension which elevates it in mind (and marks). With water, there’s antiseptic cream mingling with oxidized fruits and nuts; think manzanilla pasada. The palate shows storm clouds gathering over Texa. Rich dried fruits, cacao, and a ferny lift on the finish. Fantastic. (The Whisky Exchange only)  £100",
"Blue Hanger 11th Limited Release, 45.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,137,101 to 500 Dollars,"From whisky connoisseur David Stirk's Exclusive Malts Single Cask Cask Strength range, this is a blend made with 80% malt, and it shows. This is a beauty. It's also a ‘traffic light’ whisky, with the sort of whisky rancio associated with the oldest whiskies up front, peaches and cream and pureed fruit in the center, and changing to oaky spiciness late on. Whisky with body, depth, and balance, which morph seamlessly. Very good indeed.",
"Oban Little Bay, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Peat Monster is a staple Compass Box blended malt whisky, but this raises the bar significantly. The nose is “as you were”: peat reek, seaside, very Islay. But on the palate John Glaser's added some peaty Highland whisky—probably a signature Clynelish—to add a hint of licorice, a softer, fruitier smoke base, and through some virgin French oak, a delightful spiciness. Compass Box is in a purple patch. Again.",
"Compass Box This Is Not A Luxury Whisky, 53.1%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,225,101 to 500 Dollars,"Quite earthy, with orris root, burlap, and dunnage warehouse notes.  Distinctly meaty—Bovril (beef stock)—then cedary. This untamed edge—think Mortlach or Benrinnes—dominates the palate, but the cask (a refill butt) isn’t overstating its presence. There’s espresso on the finish. Here’s Glenfarclas taking a ramble on the wild side. If your preference is for more robust styles, then look no further. £345",
"Chivas Regal 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Chocolate-covered raisins scoffed on a heathery moor, leather riding tack, intense plain chocolate, malt loaf, mixed nuts, Medjool dates, and traces of wood ash. A gorgeous, unctuous mouthfeel with flavors spun around bright sparks of orange, dark toffee, and rich maltiness, melding to black cherry, stewed fruits, licorice, and charred oak.

"Big Peat Christmas Edition 2015, 53.8%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"A classic mature ‘Fiddich nose, that mix of chocolate, sweet fruits, and funkiness. Dried apples, a little currant, but also a pure thread of sweetness. In time, a little fresh mushroom. Complex. Soft on the tongue, so you need to concentrate on what’s happening. Later becomes minty, with supple tannins and a little artichoke on the finish. Water needs to be handled carefully to bring out green herbal notes. I’d probably keep water on the side. Excellent.

"Compass Box The Circus, 49%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,275,101 to 500 Dollars,"Not what you’d expect from a malt at this age.

Is it the expense? Packaging? Good taste? Masquerading behind a green apple, a bowler-hatted John Glaser smiles enigmatically. Sultanas, charcoal smoke, toffee, chocolate, sea salt, and warm sherry tones. The alcohol rides with dense black cherry, cacao nibs, Colombian coffee, and dark fruits.

Lovely antique amber color. The Madeira dovetails beautifully with the malt and oak, and it has matured nicely for a whisky less than ten years old. Lush notes of orange marmalade, raspberry tart, and panforte, all wrapped up in rich toffee and a dusting of nutmeg, cinnamon, and cocoa.

Indeed, I feel that the 17 year old displays the true essence of Bowmore. But this 18 year old integrates the sherry notes with the Bowmore signature to create a richly flavored Islay whisky experience. Thick toffee, ripe fruit, and tar-tinged smoke are accentuated by dark chocolate, cocoa powder, burnt raisin, dates, and sea salt. Long, entertaining finish.

This one is finished in Pedro Ximenez (PX) sherry. With PX being so rich and intense, and Glenmorangie spirit so subtly complex and delicate, does the sherry dominate here? No, it doesn’t. Still, this is viscous and very textural for a Glenmorangie. I’m picking up rhum agricole drenched with honeyed apricot, toffee almond, chocolate-covered raisin, glazed citrus, and cherry pits, all leading to a leathery, tobacco-tinged finish. A visceral whisky with plenty of grip. Great for after dinner.",

"Glenfiddich 1977 Vintage (Cask #4414), 54.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,750,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Surprisingly fresh - sanguine even - for its age, and appetizingly aromatic. Fairly light and approachable in body, but always inspiring and pithy. Notes of fresh, seabreeze brine, teasing exotic spices, and tangerine are softened by gently creamy malt notes and hints of coconut and almond. Very delicious and enjoyable anytime.",
"Oban, 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"Amber color. Full aroma of peat smoke, with interwoven notes of seaweed, burning leaves, leather, and fudge. Medium in body, with a slight oily texture. Powerful and evolving in flavor, with great depth. It begins somewhat sweet up front with notes of vanilla and toffee, followed by a peat smoke explosion. Lingering notes of seaweed, oak, salt and pepper add complexity. Finally, the whisky becomes slightly sweet again, with lingering smoke. 
",
"Brora, 25 year old, 56.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,350,101 to 500 Dollars,"This replaces the 17 year old in the standard Bowmore portfolio. (The 17 year old will now be Duty Free Only). The difference is significant. This one is more sherried than the 17 year old, and it wears the sherry well. I know that many of you, like myself, adore the 17 year old. Indeed, I feel that the 17 year old displays the true essence of Bowmore. But this 18 year old integrates the sherry notes with the Bowmore signature to create a richly flavored Islay whisky experience. Thick toffee, ripe fruit, and tar-tinged smoke are accentuated by dark chocolate, cocoa powder, burnt raisin, dates, and sea salt. Long, entertaining finish. 
",
"Dewar's 18 year old Founder's Reserve, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Fresh and lively for its age, with appetizing saltiness, citrus fruit (lemon, line and orange marmalade), and subtly complex dried spices. A fat, malty foundation complements these seasonings beautifully mid-palate, with the salt and dried spices emerging again on the finish. Very sophisticated. 
",
"Port Askaig, 17 year old, 45.8% ",Single Malt Scotch,91,81,0 to 100 Dollars,"More polished and sophisticated than the comparably sweet and lush Lagavulin 21 year old also reviewed here. The pedro ximinez cask finish certainly gives as much as it takes away when compared to the benchmark 16 year old. An array of complex ripe fruit, interwoven with notes of pot still rum, toffee, tar, seaweed, and brine on the finish. It seems logical to marry this big, smoky Islay whisky with an equally big, sweet, fruity sherry. In this case, the marriage works wonderfully.",
"Glenlivet Nadurra Triumph 1991, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,91,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"Significantly darker than the rest, well-balanced, and palate-coating. Softer, not as intense or as dry as the 30 year old. Creamier too, with subtle, yet exotic notes of tropical fruit and exotic spices. There is a point at which ultra-aged spirits -- whether they are whisky, rum, tequila, or brandy -- find a common ground. What they lose in identity, they gain in intrigue and layers of subtle complexity (if properly matured). This whisky fits into that category. Contemplative and ethereal in nature.",
"Compass Box 'Lady Luck', 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,170,101 to 500 Dollars,"Very elegant and refined. Obviously this whisky was aged in a pristine sherry cask. The flavors are quite clean and well-defined. Gently sweet and fruity, with golden raisin, candy apple, and red raspberry jam. There’s delicate pineapple, dried cherry, coconut, and vanilla too, with a polished oak finish. A very classy Glenfiddich. Not as bold and spicy as last year’s 1976 vintage (which I had a hand in selecting but, ironically, don’t like as much). This new vintage approaches the caliber of the 1973 Vintage release from two years ago which I still think is the best one in recent years.",
"Oban, 2000 vintage, 58.7%",Single Malt Scotch,91,488,101 to 500 Dollars,"Drier, less toffee and fruit, more dried spice and oak when compared to the standard Oban 14 year old.  A beautiful combination of rich, nutty toffee balanced by polished oak, salt, pepper, seaweed, distant smoke, and dried fruit.  Somewhat oily in texture.  Wonderful depth, too!  An improvement on what is already the biggest-selling Diageo single malt scotch in the U.S.  Very exciting and dynamic.  (7,700 bottles available only in the U.S. and at the Oban distillery).
",
"The Balvenie Single Barrel 15 year old (Cask #7266), 47.8%",Single Malt Scotch,91,62,0 to 100 Dollars,"Quite lively for 25 years, with layers of bright fruit (lemon, nectarine, grapefruit, pineapple) on a bed of vanilla and honey. There’s a peppering of dried spice, smoldering ember, and beach pebbles. Lightly smoky, dried spice finish. Very nice. Brora enthusiasts will not be disappointed, but the prices of the whisky from this shuttered distillery are creeping up.
",
"The Dalmore Mackenzie 1992 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,175,101 to 500 Dollars,"Available for several years, but now finally making its debut in the U.S. The higher-end Dewar’s expressions (Dewar’s 12 year old and Dewar’s Signature) are very good blends. This one is situated smartly between the two. The malt proportion is rich and creamy; the grain whisky is crisp and well-integrated. Antique gold color, with notes of butterscotch, vanilla wafer, strawberry rhubarb pie, and citrus drizzled with honey. Lovely floral notes in the aroma, along with a pleasing, dried spice finish. I could drink this stuff all day long!",
"Clynelish, 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,96,0 to 100 Dollars,"A new line of Islay single malts from Specialty Drinks, an extension of The Whisky Exchange. (The bottle doesn’t tell you which distillery this whisky came from, but if you look at a map of Islay you can probably figure it out.) I like this expression better than the more expensive 25 year old. There’s impeccable balance and more vibrancy in this 17 year old, with seaweed, smoked Spanish olive, coal soot, pencil shavings, citrus, and anise, along with subtle kipper and picked ginger. All this is layered on a bed of oily, honeyed malt. Salty, peppery, sooty, tarry finish. Nicely done! £50",
"Hart Brothers 18 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 1990 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"Richly textured with mouth-coating malt that is balanced by an array of lively fruit (fresh peach, nectarine, tangerine, pears in honey, and delicately caramelized pineapple). Creamy caramel, crème brûlée, anise, and subtle toasted marshmallow add complexity, as does its gently spicy, pleasingly dry finish. Two years older than the standard 16 year old Nadurra (which I like for its vibrancy and freshness). This new Triumph 1991 is richer and more textured, with more caramelized sugars, riper barley, and greater fruit impact. More mouth-coating too. (Exclusive to the U.S.)",
"Glenfarclas 175th Anniversary, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,131,101 to 500 Dollars,"A marriage of two casks of Caol Ila (25 and 29 years old) and one cask of Imperial (14 years old). Penetratingly smoky, visceral, rooty, and even mean-tempered at times, ultimately being soothed by creamy vanilla and thick malt. It’s peppered with licorice stick, dark chocolate, campfire charcoal, subtle olive brine, and teasing berried fruit. Long, clinging finish. The flavors are nicely integrated and complex. Well done! (A limited release.)
",
"Glen Grant 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,407,101 to 500 Dollars,"Matured in a sherry cask. Lush, with glazed citrus, caramelized peach, chewy toffee, roasted nuts, and subtle pine needles. The sherry is a driving force throughout this whisky, but it’s obviously from a very clean, polished European oak cask. Very delicious, with a long, satiating finish. Quite impressive for such a young whisky. My favorite of the bunch. (534 bottles) £300",
"The Macallan 18 year old Sherry Oak, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,118,101 to 500 Dollars,"One of the finest Balvenie 15 year olds I’ve tasted. The flavors are clean, well defined, confident, and beautifully balanced. Full malty foundation (with some ripe barley thrown in). Soft, creamy vanilla, honeycomb, bright fruit (orange, nectarine, lemon peel, hints of pineapple), with emerging dried vanilla, coconut, oak resin, and subtle anise. Polished oak finish. It doesn’t have the depth that the classic older Balvenies have shown in the past, but what it does have, it has in spades. Beautiful! (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)",
"Mortlach 16 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"A tribute to the Mackenzie Clan. Aged in bourbon barrels for 11 years, and then aged an additional 6 years in port pipes, creating a rich, voluptuous, robust Dalmore expression. Notes of toffee, molasses, caramelized nuts, pancake batter, fig cake, and chocolate-covered citrus. Subtle glazed ginger and orange marmalade add complexity. Polished oak, tobacco-tinged finish. Very dynamic and never sappy or cloying. Save this one for after dinner.",
"Balblair 1995, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"There’s something enigmatic and highly attractive about this distillery and its deceased brother, Brora. Perhaps it’s the unpredictability; there are plenty of independent releases of varied and often questionable quality, and you’re never quite sure what’s going to turn up. Even iconic expressions such as the 30 year olds can vary from quite sublime to appalling and sulfury when in the wrong hands.
When the malts from both distilleries are good, though — and the official bottlings tend to be — they’re very, very good. This Clynelish is a delightful surprise from the beginning, its nose some way removed from the official 14 year old, and more in common with some recent Diageo-release Broras, mixing soft maritime notes with squiggly peat and some fruit notes. The palate is complex and attractive, with savory peat, sweet pineapple, salt, light fish, drizzled lemon, pepper, chili, and cardamom. It all makes for a big, complex, evolving (and grown up) whisky — and great value for the price tag. ",
"Compass Box Great King Street Artist's Blend, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"Bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered. Smart move! It really helps this whisky. This is a soft — almost elegant — Laphroaig (if that’s not an oxymoron). Very clean, with honeyed malt, ripe barley, brine, seaweed, and peat smoke, with just a teasing of the medicinal, band-aid notes that Laphroaig is known for. The owner-bottled 18 year old, which I rated a 90, is darker and drier, with more oak on the finish. I like this Hart Brothers expression just a little better.",
"Adelphi (distilled at BenRiach) 34 year old 1977 Vintage, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,91,283,101 to 500 Dollars,"First things first — congratulations to the Grants of Glenfarclas on attaining their 175th anniversary. To celebrate, they have vatted together a cask from 1952 with one each from the following five decades — and released it at an exceptionally reasonable price! The nose has a lift of struck match immediately followed by cedar, pomegranate, blackberry jam, and Seville orange. There’s a thick caramel toffee sweetness to the palate alongside the classic ’Farclas depth where dried, but sweet, fruits repose. Recommended. £80 (Dave Broom) (Value Pick)",
"The Dalmore Distillery Exclusive 1991, 59%",Single Malt Scotch,91,236,101 to 500 Dollars,"Glen Grant’s new(ish) owner Campari is putting its money where its mouth is. Investment in plant, wood, and an impressive visitor center is slowly being backed up with a series of new releases. This venerable example comes from Gordon & MacPhail’s stocks, but is an official bottling due out in time for Christmas. This is GG in relaxed, avuncular mode: subtle woods, amber, Oolong tea, anise. The palate is old apple, fresh plum, cream, and ginger spiciness. £255(Available at the distillery, in France, and Travel Retail in Asia only.)",
"Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1980 (bottled 2011), 43.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,1593,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Macallan’s 18 year old expression is, for me, the highlight of its regular sherried range. Deep amber in color. The nose is rich and heavily fruited: fruit cake, mulberry, a little moist gingerbread, the bloody depths of molasses. On the palate, dried fruits — more figgy than raisined — while the natural oiliness in the spirit balances the boisterous tannins from the European oak. A singed note on the finish (an extension of the molasses?) completes the picture. Balanced and complex.",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Royal Lochnagar) 23 year old 1986, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"With worm tubs and a fiendishly complex partial-triple distillation, Mortlach has adhered to an old style of making whisky — and older, richer, darker flavors. Big and bold, it is at its best in ex-sherry casks. The nose is meaty (think gravy/beef stock) with fig, raisin, and molasses. In the mouth it’s concentrated, with good grip and a savory sweetness. A cult malt. £41 (Not available in the U.S.)",
"Glenfarclas Family Cask 1970 (Cask #140), 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,530,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The latest Balblair release is a 1995 vintage expression, exclusive to global travel retail outlets. Matured in second-fill bourbon casks, Balblair 1995 is non-chill filtered and naturally colored. Initially very fruity on the nose, with peaches and carnations, icing sugar on bonbons, then a faint sprinkling of black pepper. Stewed fruits on the early palate, full and confident, with developing spices and brittle toffee. Relatively lengthy in the finish, with dark chocolate and soft oak. Price is per 1 liter.",
"The Macallan Masters of Photography 1989 (Release 3, Cask #12251), 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,91,2750,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"After a series of esoteric and expensive releases, Compass Box has decided to bring it all back to the people with a blend — and how! The journey sets out as we might expect; all sweet vanilla ice cream, stewed pear tart, and peach melba, but then a wave of spice and white pepper provides an unexpected but delightful twist. It’s like Spice Tree meets Hedonism…Spiconism if you like.",
"The Dalmore 1969 42 year old, 45.5%",Single Malt Scotch,91,24000,10001 and above,"Sweet and sherried, with plenty of sugar and toffee, moving into plums and thick chestnut honey. Give it time, however, and a haunting note of dried mango and guava emerges, followed by amontillado-style nuttiness and then beeswax polish. All in all, just what you want from a gently-aged BenRiach. The palate may seem initially grippy, but there’s such a massing of fruits that it copes well. Keep neat for maximum impact. Superb. £180",
"Cutty Sark Tam o' Shanter 25 year old, 46.5%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,329,101 to 500 Dollars,"Staff members at Dalmore selected this distillery-exclusive bottling, which has been drawn from American white oak cask number 446, and bottled at cask strength. The out-turn comprises 450 bottles. Refined, polished oak on the nose. Honey, marzipan, caramel, and vanilla. Fragrant, with old leather and over-ripe oranges when water is added. Warm leather, apricots, orange marmalade, cocoa powder, and developing spice on the palate. A long, spicy, citric finish. Finally, licorice. £150",
"Old Pulteney 40 Year Old, 51.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,2313,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"A vatting of three first-fill American oak casks, for me this is the most lifted and effusive of the ongoing Cellar Collection range. The nose is full of aromas of anise, blackcurrant leaf, honeysuckle, jasmine, frangipani flowers, and a subtle almond sweetness. The palate continues in similar vein with more spice and just sufficient oak to add distinct structure and a coconut character. Sublime. It won’t, however, be released in the U.S. £1,000",
"Glen Garioch Cask #992 14 year old 1998, 54.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"It's not made clear which Islay malts are included in this blended malt, but whoever's responsible for this has brought the big guns. This successfully pulls off an intense one-two, with hard hitting Islay peat and brine on the one hand, and some rich sweetness on the other, making for a mouth-coatingly rich and intense whisky. The malts pack down together like a rugby scrum and combine with impressive intensity. €36",
"Caol Ila Feis Ile Bottling 2013, 56.5%",Single Malt Scotch,91,152,101 to 500 Dollars,"Another first fill sherry butt, giving its typical reddish-brown hue. This runs more into the clove, cassia, and allspice area than just dried fruit. While maturity is obvious, and there’s even a hint of dunnage/leatheriness, it is the concentrated fruit sweetness that surprises here. The distillery has fought back against the cask, and while still crepuscular in nature, there is a rich, concentrated, and mellow glow at its heart. £345",
"The Coronation (distilled at Glenfarclas) 1953, 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,9500,5001 to 10000 Dollars,"Dark mahogany with ruby glints and a green rim. Lots of highly-polished oak as we move out of the woods and into a silent country estate. Wax polish and masses of whisky rancio. Sherry-soaked oak, dry leaves, currants, and ripe blackberry. Highly concentrated, but the fruits push their way through only lightly-resisting tannins. There’s a hint of smoke and Seville orange bitterness on the finish. My pick of the quartet. Excellent. 285 bottles.",
"Lombard Jewels of Scotland (distilled at Springbank) 21 year old 1991 Cask No. 172, 49.7%",Single Malt Scotch,91,375,101 to 500 Dollars,"Initially filled into an ex-bourbon cask, then transferred into a Gonzales Byass oloroso ‘Matusalem’ sherry butt in 2005 for four years, before a final two years in a freshly-emptied bourbon barrel. The nose is initially floral, with overripe Seville oranges, figs, ginger, and cocoa powder. Peaches and almonds on the palate, before dark fruits and salted nuts appear. Drying oak is held at bay, and the final note is fat and figgy. Cask number 14; 233 bottles.",
"Kilchoman 2007, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,51,0 to 100 Dollars,"In my opinion Cutty Sark 25 year old is one of the great blends, so a new version was always going to be a big ask. This one comes with a lot of packaging, so is it a victory for style over substance? Not at all. This is all about big flavors; burnt orange, juicy raisin, and dark chocolate; rich oak and exotic spice. A treat, and worthy of its heritage. But at that price—and bearing in mind it's a limited edition—are you going to open it? ",
"Glenglassaugh 30 year old, 44.8%",Single Malt Scotch,91,395,101 to 500 Dollars,"The oldest bottling of Old Pulteney to date has been matured in American bourbon and Spanish sherry casks, and was personally bottled by distillery manager Malcolm Waring. The nose of this highly accomplished veteran is fragrant and waxy, with cooking apples, milk chocolate orange, Christmas spices, vanilla, and fudge. Initially, the substantial palate offers spicy fresh fruits, seasoned timber, then a hint of brine, with sultanas and plain chocolate. The finish is figgy, gingery, and sherried. £1,490",
"Signatory (distilled at Caol Ila) 1984, 54.7%",Single Malt Scotch,91,258,101 to 500 Dollars,"The follow-up to last year’s Ardbeg Day, here’s the cult distillery in its funkiest
guise with a nose that’s reminiscent (I’d imagine) of a frontier trading post:
all pitch, furs, and gun oil. Some mint hangs around in the background
alongside eucalyptus. This is an earthy, in-your-face Ardbeg with a hint of
box-fresh sneakers indicating some youthfulness. The mouth is thick and chewy:
wild mint, oily depths, and the slightly manic energy typical of Ardbeg’s young
years. Editor's Choice.",
"Ardbeg Supernova Committee bottling 2014, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,91,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Although aged in refill, then active hoggies, and finally sherry, there’s more smoke
than oak here, a smoke like the aroma of a fire clinging to a tweed jacket. A
note akin to wilting spinach gives way to more conventional strawberries and
cream, but always mixed with seashore breezes. This is Caol Ila in deep and
bold mood with green fig, banana, and a sweet center. Water gives greater
integration. You might (just) be able to get this. Do it. (distillery only) £99",
"John Walker & Sons Private Collection 2014 Edition, 46.8%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,840,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Only 60 bottles have been released from this 60 year old first-fill sherry cask. Amazingly, the nose is not dominated by wood, but is mature and concentrated with the aroma of rain-moistened tweed, tropical fruit, blonde tobacco, cedar, and chanterelle mushroom. This elegantly faded, sepia-tinted impression continues on the tongue: fine-boned, mossy, clean, and slowly drying. A classic example of oxidation, not woodiness, allowing freshness to be retained. Amazing. (The Whisky Exchange exclusive.) £6,000",
"The Balvenie Tun 1509, 47.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,369,101 to 500 Dollars,"Aged in a bourbon hogshead, allowing the distillery character to shine through. Fresh, lively and inviting (especially for its age), with a complex array of tropical and summer fruit, peppered with brine, vanilla, and a hint of baker’s chocolate. An oily texture adds weight. Dry, deliciously appetizing finish. An excellent aperitif whisky, but enjoyable anytime. (D & M Wines and Liquors exclusive.)",
"Ardbeg Perpetuum, 47.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Robust Port Charlotte character, with salami and jamon serrano to the fore. Somewhat like eating a chorizo and roasted red pepper sandwich on the beach on a summer’s day, but it retains the sweet freshness of the distillery character. With water, the lovely smell of cow’s breath. There’s dry smoke to start with on the palate, becoming sweet (flash-fried scallop) with sugared almond on the finish. For me, PC comes fully of age here. £55",
"Craigellachie 23 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,536,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The first release from the new owners of Glenglassaugh distillery is obviously intended as a showpiece expression, and it does not disappoint. Due in the States next year. Damp moss and cedar on the early nose. Sultanas, candied orange, maraschino cherries, and sherry. Treacle notes in time. Spicy fruits, figs, brittle toffee, sherry, and ginger on the mellow yet robust palate. The finish is medium in length, with allspice and old oak, plus a wisp of tarry smoke. £245",
"Douglas Laing Extra Old Particular (distilled at Mortlach) 22 year old, 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,280,101 to 500 Dollars,"Clearly Caol Ila; it’s the way that the oily smokiness seems to lean into the nose, bearing with it wet oilskins, a barely smoldering wood fire, light seashore elements (drying crab shells), and very pure fruit, which then opens to classic smoked ham aromas. Retronasally, there’s a touch of green pea pod. The smokiness is more assertive than normal on the tongue, with olive oil, deep fruits, and a pine-scented juniper note. Another belter. (The Whisky Exchange only) £155",
"Tullibardine 1952, 40.2%",Single Malt Scotch,91,23427,10001 and above,"Pale and slightly flinty to start, with touches of Caol lla-style salt-washed rocks, but here there’s sweetness, while the smoke gives it a mezcal-like air; pears and burning wood (hot brake pads), minerality, then green olive and a light medicinal note. With water, sashimi-style cleanliness. The palate is rounded, with real olive oil, peppery sweetness, soot, and white chocolate. A real ‘palate whisky,’ filled with bare-faced bravado.  A great Ardbeg.",
"The Last Drop 1965 Blend 48 year old, 48.6%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,4000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Smoke begins Jim Beveridge’s public replication of the annual Directors Blend concept, built around Johnnie Walker’s signature characteristics. Peat smoke harks back to Islay, but there’s wood smoke, tobacco leaf, and malt, with a salty richness behind it. The grain just gives it a lift of extra sweetness. Polished, with great structure; red apple, raspberry, and sweet linctus wrap up with a long, smoky finish of cigar stub and peat stores. Clear parallels with Directors Blend 2009, but better. (8,888 decanters released) £500",
"Hart Brothers (distilled at Glen Grant) 22 year old, 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,103,101 to 500 Dollars,"This newbie from Balvenie is the worldwide replacement for the market-specific Tun 1401. A larger volume vat (8,000 liters) is now being filled with an equally eclectic mix of casks (42 casks ranging from 1970 to 1992). Deep amber; this has substance but being Balvenie, it’s gentle: orange blossom/Manuka honey edged with spice, marmalade, scented woods, and a little frangipane. The palate shows a supple, rippling power with some apricot, cinnamon, and root ginger. Awfully good. £230",
"Cadenhead’s (distilled at Linkwood) 1989, 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"The question is how this stacks up against the Friends of the Classic Malts bottling, one of my 2014 highlights. This shows mature distillery character with that discreet meaty undertow bedding down exuberant top notes: icing sugar on rhum baba, preserved lime, crystallized fruits, honey, pecan, fig, and scented woods. Typical of Cragganmore in its constantly shape-shifting character. The palate is concentrated orchard fruits, dried fruits, light spice, chestnut puree, and a little smoke. So yes, in the same league. (3,372 bottles)",
"Ardbeg Supernova 2015 Release, 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Here we see a significant step-change from the progression of 13 to 19 (see below). Now, there is added spice, ripe fresh cooked and dried fruits, and a touch of the peat smoke that used to be lightly added. With water, a mix of maple syrup and waxiness comes through. Complex and deep. The palate remains thick and silky, with melted white chocolate before lilies make an appearance alongside baked pineapple. Structured, layered, long, and elegant. £337",
"The Dalmore 21 year old, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,91,530,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Deep amber. Generous sweet sherried nose; very ripe, with dried orchard fruits, chestnut puree, and indeed chestnut honey, then a little touch of meat and a pungency akin to Guyanan pot still rum. Sumptuous. As it opens there’s a fluxing mix of sticky toffee, game, pomegranate, and dried red fruits. The palate is deeply savory, with floor polish and cooked plums, finishing with fragrant pepper. The cask has a huge say in things, but the spirit copes. Excellent. £191",
"Ballantine’s 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions – Scapa, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"This bottling is from the oldest cask owned by Tullibardine distillery, a sherry quarter cask (#341). An initial whiff of Cointreau on the nose, then vanilla develops, with marzipan, white pepper, linseed, and old hessian. Finally, musty sherry. A silky mouthfeel, with drier sherry, black currants, dark spices, and plain chocolate. Extraordinarily lingering, with orange wine gums and spicy licorice. Despite 50 years of maturation in a relatively small sherry cask, a whisky of great depth and quality has emerged. £16,000",
"Tomintoul Five Decades, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,91,359,101 to 500 Dollars,"Originally blended, then recasked into fresh bourbon wood three decades ago, the nose of ripened peaches, cooked pear, pecan nuts, menthol, clove, and vanilla make for a compelling combination. A surprising lift of red summer fruits as this bright whisky sashays around the mouth, the complexity measured out in installments; plum sauce, toasted oak, coffee bean, gingersnaps, clove, licorice, and hints of savory juices. It dances on and on with the whirling wood spices in no hurry whatsoever. (592 bottles)",
"Springbank Local Barley 16 year old, 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"A welcome return for Hart Brothers. This Glen Grant is light, clean, and penetrating, with lots of gooseberry, melon, basil, and cut grass. This turns into an intriguing note of concentrated fruits; think yellow wine gums and fresh William pear. The palate has classic Glen Grant purity, with a hint of tropical fruits. Water adds another graceful layer on top, making the effect more like a rose garden…one which you keep returning to. Excellent. £66",
"Ardbeg Dark Cove Committee Edition, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,91,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"Powerful and rich to begin with. Some raisin syrup backed with clean, apple-like acidity adding some freshness. This swells into a deep but refined musky apple/pear note with some black fruits behind. Highly complex, but full of distillery character. Water brings out a note like freshly-applied varnish. The palate is smooth, gentle, and deep. A classic mature Linkwood with all of the distillery character on show in perfect alliance with the cask.",
"Ailsa Bay, 48.9%",Single Malt Scotch,91,79,0 to 100 Dollars,"Apparently this is the final Supernova release and the Ardbeg team has ensured it goes out with all guns blazing. Although it seems calm initially—there’s a minty and sweet spicy element to the fore—the smoke begins to push through in the guise of creosote, then sootiness which, in turn, mingles with seaweed aromas. The peat dominates the palate but there is sufficient oiliness to round it out and add layers of smoked fish, and dried grasses. Farewell.",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky #1 35 year old (batch 3), 46.5%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"Dalmore released 8,000 bottles of its latest 21 year old, initially matured 10 years in American oak barrels before an 11 year period of secondary maturation in first-fill Matusalem oloroso sherry butts from Gonzalez Byass. Intense aromas of Jaffa orange, marzipan, and ginger, plus soft oak. Robust, yet stylish.

"The Balvenie PortWood 21 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,91,220,101 to 500 Dollars,"As you raise the glass to your nose, this has refreshment written all over it. The fragrance of an early morning visit to a florist, zesty orange notes, honey, peach pits, a hint of salt, and the faintest trace of smoke. It’s silky smooth, glistening with honey, a firm edge of orange, vanilla tablet, barley sugar, powdered ginger, all elevated by the grains supporting the Scapa. A smooth, feather-light finish of sparkling light spices and creaminess. A joy to behold.",
"Longmorn 23 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,91,1450,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"The soft fruit theme continues in this vatting of whiskies from, you guessed it, five decades of the distillery’s life. This has a heavy, heady, honey element alongside apple blossom and then peach and apricot pulp. There’s real complexity. The palate is lighter, although still layered with some heat. With water there’s more apricot skin and some banana. Don’t overwater, as it becomes a touch too tannic. You want that unctuous elegance. Highly recommended. £250",
"anCnoc 35 year old Second Release, 41%",Single Malt Scotch,91,615,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The first of five annual releases of Local Barley from Springbank. This practice revives a concept discontinued in 2001. The barley in question was grown at Low Machrimore Farm in the south of the Kintyre peninsula and was distilled in September 1999. Barley, damp earth, sea salt, and citrus fruits on the lightly peated nose. The buttery palate yields spicy peat, orchard fruits, and more earthiness, closing with smoky lemon.",

Very fruity on the nose—raspberries and prunes —plus lightly-smoked pineapple and vanilla. More smoky, spicy fruit features on the palate, with a light sprinkling of cinnamon. The peat dries to leave ashy licorice and black pepper in a lingering finish. The port is pleasingly discreet. (4,938 bottles for the U.S.)",
"Exclusive Malts 2006 (distilled at Linkwood) 11 year old, 58.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"What happens when you light a bonfire underneath Green Label? Earthy peat smoke with medicinal characteristics of lanolin and antiseptic, a salty tang balanced with creamy vanilla, strands of citrus, and touches of menthol and aniseed. Smooth as a thief in the night; mouth-coating toffee, growing smoky notes, and peppered mackerel push back the waxy, citrus elements. Now the fire is alive; the sweetness gets out while it can. (Travel Retail exclusive)",
"Compass Box 3 year old Deluxe, 49.2%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"This dark, chestnut liquid exudes wafts of rose hip, dense fruitcake, sliced fig, cherry, oak, Brazil nut, and earthy, fragrant damp moss within the rich sherry complexity.

The nose is classic Longmorn: soft and sweet, majoring in honey, hazelnuts, caramel, and milk chocolate, while the creamy palate features orchard fruits, ginger, and allspice. The finish is lengthy and softly spiced, with honey, orange, and sweet oak.",

"Buchanan’s Red Seal, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,169,101 to 500 Dollars,"Not the pimply youth you might be mistakenly expecting, this tongue-in-cheek release is impishly contemptuous of the regulations challenged by Glaser during the transparency debate. Lemon bonbon, heavy vanilla scents, beeswax boot polish, and white chocolate are well integrated with peat. The exotic fruits and citrus zest tumbling with golden syrup are knocked sideways by clove and pepper. Water provokes more sweet smoke. A dry, spicy, waxy finish remains. (3,282 bottles)",
"Classic Cask 23 year old Original Cask, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 2016 release in its ceramic flagon entices you with lemon, soft fruits, honey, digestive biscuits, and taffy candy.

The Monumental 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"There should be few qualms about snapping up this aged Highland gem given the blender’s prowess and the generous pricing.

Blender Maureen Robinson’s light, well-balanced creation ushers in gentle honey and growing sweetness, before billowing puffs of smoke grow dominant. Charred peaks of a lemon meringue pie, iced coffee, and milk chocolate follow, leaving a catch of smoke in the aftertaste. Quite a charmer.",
"Rock Oyster Sherry Edition, 46.8%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"This archetypal midnight dram enthralls with aromas of cedar wood humidor, blossom honey, hazelnut, vanilla pod, treacle cake, and maple syrup. Dry as leaves, save for some floaty florals.

Gentle vanilla, honey, lemon zest, and gooseberry compote waft from the glass. Vanilla frosting, coconut macaroon bars, malt drinks, peach, lemon, and an undercurrent of pepper.

The rounded palate has sweet satsuma, swathes of toasted spice, sweeping malty notes, delicious chocolate, and burnt caramel. The wafting smoke builds formidably, until it engulfs the back of the palate. Sheep Dip whisky may have been around since the 1970s, but this latest creation maps out the best of modern Islay styles to great effect. A triumphant, approachable blend that shows great strength of purpose, yet remains full of charm. Number 13 in the 2017 Top 20

"Ardbeg Supernova (2019 Release), 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,91,180,101 to 500 Dollars,"Distilling with heirloom grains has become commonplace in the U.S., but much less so in Scotland.

Aromas of a damp cellar; oily, nutty, with cereal, burlap, and mild orchard fruit notes. The palate is persistently oily, with pineapple, honey, nutmeg, and white pepper. Drying in the finish, with licorice, coal, and strong black tea. Proof that barley varieties can make a difference. (18,000 bottles; individual reviewer rating: 92)",
"Chivas Regal 13 year old Manchester United Limited Edition, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,35,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured in refill American oak casks that previously held peated whisky, this 2006 distillate presents a nose of cider, heather, ginger, malt, hints of nutmeg, and peat.

Designed for Highballs or pouring over ice, it offers a nose of vanilla sponge cake sweetness, dried grasses, green melon, spring blossoms, white pepper, and a faint trace of peppermint. It has a soft, caressing character, with melon, pulpy summer fruits, sour lemon, butterscotch, barley sugar, vanilla caramel, and a later supportive fizzle of spice. It concludes with a finish of sweet vanilla and fruits.",
"Port Ellen Untold Stories 40 year old 9 Rogue Casks, 50.9%",Single Malt Scotch,91,8417,5001 to 10000 Dollars,"Bottled in recognition of Sir Alex Ferguson’s remarkable thirteen league soccer titles, this scotch does him proud. Juicy citrus, aromatic spices, and vanilla pudding; the nose is enveloped with milk chocolate aromas and further spiciness. The blend was selectively finished in American rye barrels, and the flavors crescendo through orange, malt, chocolate, mint, and pepper, with some rye spices that usher in a lengthy, spicy finish. Blissfully good. Best Value",

Citrus fruit, vanilla, and cocoa powder on the finish.",
"Mortlach 21 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2020), 56.9%",Single Malt Scotch,91,755,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Charred oak meets grape jelly, with aromas of crushed almonds, dried blueberries, new car leather, dark chocolate-covered raisins, and a whole lot of vanilla. In the mouth it’s chewy and well-textured; add water and it turns velvety. The water brings out better balance as well, tempering the very active cask and buttressing berry, orange, cinnamon-chocolate, and espresso bean. More coffee bean, cinnamon-dusted pecans, dark chocolate, raspberry coulis, and hints of tobacco on the finish. A scotch for bourbon lovers. (268 bottles; 90 for U.S.)",
"Dalwhinnie 30 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2020), 51.9%",Single Malt Scotch,91,722,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Buckets of fresh-picked berries, pastry cream, green banana, saline, and iodine peat on the nose. It stays consistent on the palate, with sweet berries, toasted baking spice, chocolate, salty and mineral peat, and a creamy texture. The flavor builds and then, on the finish, crescendos on a wave of dark chocolate, bittersweet oak, and smoldering peat smoke. The fruit doesn’t make it to the end, but there’s no lack of a sense of completion. (1,260 bottles; U.S. exclusive)",
"Dalmore 12 year old Sherry Cask Select, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Aromatic on the nose, with vivid fruitiness mingling with briny, rubbery peat: grilled apples and pears, lemon zest, and peach slices. On the palate, it presents as simple, but wait a beat to let the whisky settle—and add a bit of water—and that simplicity reads more as softness in texture. The flavors are expressive and consistent with the nose: lemon and lime zest, peach, apricot, and salty-peppery peat. It finishes with bittersweet smoke, tobacco leaf, black pepper, and lingering oak. (250 bottles; U.S. exclusive)",
"Blackadder 9 year old Raw Cask Smoking Islay, 59.4%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"Perfumy in both aroma and flavor: rose potpourri, peach blossom, lemon drops, strawberry shortcake, talcum powder, and clean cereal notes on the nose. Candied rose petal on the palate, as well as dried fruit (especially with water), rich and well-integrated spice, cacao nibs, and dry oak. It’s distinctive and well-balanced, even when the oak seems a touch bitter. The finish is dry and leathery, with pipe tobacco, cinnamon, and, still, that rose note. (172 bottles; U.S. exclusive)",
"Single Malts of Scotland 10 year old Clynelish Single Cask (Distilled in 2010; Cask No. 700051), 57.4%",Single Malt Scotch,91,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Initially, a fleeting aroma of farmyard, followed by furniture polish, spice, apple peel, and cocktail cherries. Smooth on the palate, with dried fruit, chewy oak, raisins, and more cocktail cherries. Spicy dark berries, ginger, and licorice in the finish.",
"Single Malts of Scotland 20 year old Ardbeg Single Cask (Distilled in 2001; Cask No. 1-93), 51.8%",Single Malt Scotch,91,600,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The nose is strikingly different than what is typical of Chivas Regal; aside from tequila, there are a lot of floral notes, perfumed soaps, Jaffa orange, and a little pepper. Pear and tequila notes on the palate reverberate around a central hub of spice before sweetness breaks through, surfing a wave of orange, grapefruit juice, and fresh green apple. A very smooth drink; this is sweet, spicy, and invigorating.",
"King's Crest, 25 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"Nostalgic aromas of wafers, white chocolate, hints of spice, and vanilla ice cream make this a mouthwatering choice. Sweet and creamy, there are rich flavors of vanilla panna cotta, candied fruit, pear, apricot, and white chocolate, adding caramel, custard creams, and sliced banana toward the end. Inspired by great blenders from many generations ago, this is astonishingly good for pleasurable drinking and mixing.",
"Murray McDavid (Distilled at Ardbeg) 1990, 8 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Oily on the nose, with spent matches, resin, and grilled meat, then vanilla, citrus fruit,
old leather, and a developing floral note. Initially very fruity on the muscular palate,
with cracked pepper, stewed root vegetables, and dark chocolate appearing in time.
Peppery oak, ginger, and soy sauce in the finish. Price is for entire Prima & Ultima
Collection, of which this whisky is a part. (389 bottles) £20,000",
"Benromach 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"So good, they didn’t name it twice. More brooding than the first iteration, with a heavy curtain of ashy sooty smoke, fresh herbal tones, lemon, and dried fruity sweetness. The palate is led by red cherry, plum, cranberry, and tangy orange peel, then hot smoke sets off a peppery firecracker. The structure is deceptively light, developing more grip as the lemon sherbet sweetness heralds the lengthy finish of beach bonfire smoke. (8,436 bottles)",
"Auchentoshan 36 year old 1966 Vintage, 49.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Glencraig was the name given to the single malt made using Lomond stills at Glenburgie Distillery. The nose leads with linseed oil, then coconut, malt, dark chocolate fondant, and tiramisu. Oily on the palate, with sweet orange, cocoa powder, and ginger.

"The Balvenie 30 year old, 47.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,550,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Aged in a mix of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry-seasoned casks, this has a peppery, slightly savory nose, offering boiled sweets and dried fruits. The palate is voluptuous, with sherry, dates, caramel, dark spices, and oak tannins. Licorice and a suggestion of chile in the ultimately drying, lengthy, slightly meaty finish. (7,692 bottles)",
"BenRiach 30 year old 1976 vintage (Cask #4469), 55.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,400,101 to 500 Dollars,"Pipe tobacco, white pepper, and a mildly herbal note on the nose, with emerging vanilla, green berries, and ginger.

"Bowmore 34 year old 1971 vintage, 51%",Single Malt Scotch,90,800,501 to 1000 Dollars,"

The nose is rich, with new leather, sultanas, dates, furniture polish, ginger, Jaffa oranges, and cloves. Silky on the palate, mandarin oranges with cream, developing toffee, milky coffee, and milk chocolate. The long finish offers nougat, dark chocolate, licorice, and light spices.",
"Bowmore 15 year old Darkest, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"

You looking for adventure, my friend? Follow me. Enveloped in sweet aromatic smoke, this wraps you in a headlock, enabling smoke to snake into your nostrils and blow out both ears. Blistering smoky precision, with shredded lemon peel, île flottante, toffee, jasmine, and cinnamon bark. A palate of lemon meringue pie, vanilla, light toffee, and pepper conceals its true strength. For hedonists: Rowdy, with a chance of peat for all. (278 bottles, 90 for U.S.)—",
"Signatory (distilled at Brora), 24 year old, 1981 vintage, Cask # 06/656, 60.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,225,101 to 500 Dollars,"

Fruit and grain drive this solid sipper, with aromas of banana, cantaloupe, almond paste, and lemon-ginger tea to start. In the mouth, it’s rounded and full, showing zingy lemon, biscuity malt, cooked bananas, and milk chocolate. Water brings out brighter fruit flavors: strawberry, lemon, and green apple hard candies. The finish comes full circle, with bananas, lemon, almonds, and vanilla. (216 bottles; U.S. exclusive)",
"Bruichladdich 15 year old 2nd Edition, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"

At first whiff, the nose is classic Islay peat: kelp and kippers, with the rubbery pop of new vinyl couch cushions. Add a little water, and fresh lemon and grapefruit burst from the glass: a welcome surprise. The oily palate highlights both—abundant saline peat and zippy citrus—with a tingle of white pepper that lingers in the nose well into the finish, which also has roasted walnuts, nori, ash, and oak. (192 bottles; U.S. exclusive)",
"Bruichladdich 3D The Big Peat, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,90,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Amber gold color. Aromas of delicate fruit, coconut, vanilla and toffee, with delicate background oak notes. The flavor delivers what the aroma promises. It is nicely balanced, with a lingering dryish finish. 
",
"Bruichladdich 1973 vintage, 40.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,285,101 to 500 Dollars,"Pale white wine color. Smoky, youthful aroma. There’s no surprises here-it definitely smells like a young Ardbeg. Big beautiful explosion of smoky, tarry flavors that evolve and seem to linger on the palate indefinitely. This is the first Ardbeg release I've tasted since the distillery's long shut down in the 1980s. After the shut down, they discontinued their floor maltings, so I was concerned that it might not taste like the Ardbeg of old. Ardbeg fans can let out a big sigh of relief. This one is big and gutsy-just the way we like it. My only criticism of this particular release is that it could have used about one or two more years in oak to tame some of the spirity nature of the whisky. Otherwise, this is wonderful stuff!",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Bruichladdich) 34 year old 1969 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,234,101 to 500 Dollars,"Aged in first and (mostly) second fill sherry casks. The sherry is kept in balance and does not mask Auchentoshan’s subtle beauty. The classic Auchentoshan creamy, grassy, freshness abounds, complemented by honey-soaked almonds, cereal grain, and an array of bright fruit (citrus, sultana, mandarin). Not as polished as the Auchentoshan 21 year old, but quite entertaining. (420 bottles for the U.S.)",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 36 year old 1967 vintage, 40.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Amber color, with gold hues. Soft, subtly seductive aromas of creamy vanilla, crème brulee, tropical fruit, oak, and a hint of mint. Light to medium in body-silky in texture at first, then becoming and firm. On the palate, the whisky starts out gently sweet, with creamy vanilla and honeyed malt. Subtle tropical fruit notes arrive mid palate. The whisky then begins to dry out fairly rapidly (this is a 36 year old Lowland after all), as dry resinous notes of vanilla, mint, and herbs reveal themselves. The whisky finishes dry, with notes of soft leather. The way the owners of Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch are handling vintage bottlings now is that specialty retailer orders an entire cask and sells it exclusively. This one is a Sam's exclusive. It's older than the previous, widely distributed 1966 bottling and less expensive too! You wouldn't expect a triple distilled Lowland whisky to age so gracefully. Auchentoshan is an exception to the rule. It has acquired the depth and maturity from extensive aging, yet it still manages to maintain its distillery character and Lowland gentility. Only on the dry finish does it really show its age. But that's a small price to pay for an otherwise very good single cask whisky at a very reasonable price for 36 years old.",
"Bunnahabhain 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,265,101 to 500 Dollars,"A special Balvenie to honor Master Distiller David Stewart’s 30 years working at the distillery. This is a big and brooding dram. The aroma suggests it is aged in both bourbon and sherry oak. It’s complex and richly flavored (sweeter up front and increasingly dry towards its finish), with notes of honey, candied fruit, thick cut marmalade, vanilla, almonds, and prominent spicy oak notes. I’m picking up plenty of sherry in this new expression, which I like. It finishes firmly dry, with notes of spice and tannin. While I enjoy this whisky a great deal, you might want to seek out the Balvenie 25 year old (which I rated a 93) while the odd bottle is still available. It is slightly more rounded on the palate, and less than half the cost.",
"Signatory (distilled at Bunnahabhain) cask #2540 27 year old 1978 vintage, 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Beautifully clean and polished on the palate -- it still allows BenRiach’s other flavors to shine through. Ripe, complex tropical fruit notes meld with delicate honey and suggestions of shortbread cookies and toasted coconut. Teasing peat and smoke surfaces from time to time. This whisky is a lot of fun to drink. (800 bottles total; 120 for the U.S.)",
"Adelphi (distilled at Clynelish), 1989, 10 year old, 61.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"A lovely example of a mature, sherried Bowmore. Its rich flavors evolve on the palate and are nicely balanced. Lush fruit, juicy oak, damp peat, and kiln smoke are peppered with cinnamon, raisins, dates, and cocoa. Warming, soothing finish. Not quite Black Bowmore, but a delicious whisky nonetheless. 
",
"Cragganmore 10 year old, 60.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"Darkest now has an age statement of 15 years old. This new release is an improvement from the original Darkest, both of which are succulently sherried. It is fuller in flavor and more visceral, in both the nose and palate. These differences are subtle, but positive. Notes of lush fruit, raisin, pot-still rum, and Heath bars. Citrus and wood spices emerge, along with burning peat embers that linger on the finish. Nicely done. 
",
"Signatory 'Unchillfiltered' (distilled at Cragganmore), 15 year old, 1989 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,59,0 to 100 Dollars,"The distillery closed in 1983, and was replaced by the Clynelish distillery across the street. Classic Brora. Fresh, and exuberant for a 25 year old whisky. Briny, with citrus zest, fruit gum drops, dynamic spices, and a hint of seaweed and smoke. Appetizing finish. All the flavors are well-integrated, and the whisky is very clean. If you don’t have a Brora yet, get this one before it’s gone. 
",
"Mackillop's Choice (distilled at Glenlivet) 27 year old 1977 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"Finished in Chateau d’Yquem casks, and it shows. There’s a creamy, honeyed sweetness and viscosity to this whisky that is very soothing. Bruichladdich’s brisk sea character cuts through the lightly syrup-like thickness and keeps the whisky fresh and lively, while notes of golden raisin, peaches, lemon gum drops, vanilla, and coconut add complexity. Satisfying salty/sweet finish.",
"Glenlivet Nàdurra 16 year old, 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"A marriage of Bruichladdich with three different peating levels. Devotees of young, smoky Islay whiskies will enjoy this one. It is youthful and explosive, with earthy peat smoke, fish nets, brine, and kiln ash. All this is tamed beautifully by notes of vanilla wafer, seductive malt, marshmallow, spiced peaches, and pear.",
"Glenlivet French Oak 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,90,36,0 to 100 Dollars,"This one is my favorite of the four distillery-bottled Bruichladdich whiskies reviewed here. It still quite lively and nicely balanced for such a mature whisky (and reminiscent of the previous 1970 vintage in this respect), with some floral notes and brine emerging from its fruity, vanilla, truffle, nougat foundation. Still, it maintains an air of lightness and freshness throughout, with a pleasingly dry, subtly spicy finish that lingers.",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glenlivet) 1968 Vintage 35 year old, 43.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,155,101 to 500 Dollars,"An unusual, but very fine, Bruichladdich, with sweet, chewy toffee notes I often associate with Speyside whiskies, not Islay (although I have tasted a few older Bunnahabhain whiskies that were like this). Layers of marzipan and chocolate fudge also emerge, and I even pick up some apple and black cherry fruit in the background. Bruichladdich's ""sea breeze"" freshness rises through the chewy sweetness and provides balance and complexity.",
"Glenmorangie Margaux Cask Finish 18 year old 1987 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,450,101 to 500 Dollars,"Older expressions of this unpeated Islay dram are often quite delicious, but they aren't easy to come by. The best ones, like this one, take the sweetish toffee/nutty foundation of younger expressions and add layers of depth and complexity. This whisky just continues to evolve on the palate. The entrance is creamy in texture with layers of sweetness (caramel, vanilla fudge, toffee), becoming nutty and marzipan-like with subtle background fruit. The finish is long and pleasingly dry, with a hint of salt. Very entertaining and satisfying.",
"Glenmorangie 1981 Sauternes Wood Finish, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"Nougat and dates to the fore, then becoming increasingly nutty with suggestions of Demerara rum and cinnamon and underlying polished leather. Lovely dried spice notes and an appetizing salty tang teases the palate on the finish.",
"The Glenrothes, 1987, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,53,0 to 100 Dollars,"Very fragrant on the nose, and thick on the palate. The flavors are chock full of thick chewy toffee, chocolate fudge, roasted nuts, burnt raisin, black currant, and spiced oak. There’s a hint of salt and Earl Grey tea on the finish. Very dynamic.",
"The Glenrothes, 1979 Vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Straw color. Fresh, appetizing aroma. Light-medium body. Nicely balanced flavors. Both the aroma and palate express notes of spices (Dijon mustard), brine, exotic peppers, caramel, and fruit. Lingering finish. 
",
"Highland Park 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Very dry, fragrant and spicy. Medium bodied, but firm. Initial, flirtatious notes of honey, creamy caramel and oatcakes quickly become dry and arid, with a foundation of leather and oak shavings. The whisky is peppered throughout with notes of anise, coffee, dried herbs and undertones of Madeira. Very forward and bullishly dry for its age, and more intense than the standard Cragganmore bottling. It’s rare for a whisky this young to be so complex. 
",
"The Macallan 1861 Replica, 42.7%",Single Malt Scotch,90,180,101 to 500 Dollars,"Independent bottlings of Cragganmore are hard to come by, and this one is a beauty. Cragganmore is not rich, heavy, or sweet like many Speyside whiskies. This one is medium-bodied, yet firm. It is clean on the palate throughout (with a brief honeyed vanilla note before becoming dry), and it is loaded with spice and dried fruits that continue to evolve. Long, lingering, finish. The decision to forego chill-filtering certainly reveals more of this whisky’s subtle, yet persistent, complexity. 
",
"Port Ellen, 1979 vintage, 28 year old, 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"A very clean whisky, with fragrant dried flowers, aromas of germinating barley, textured honey, vanilla waver, coconut cream and teasing fresh pineapple. Drying, delicately minty finish. For those who love the richly elegant, non-sherried style of older Glenlivet whiskies.",
"Peerless (distilled at Strathisla) 1967, 35 year old, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Aged exclusively in first-fill bourbon casks and bottled unfiltered and at natural cask strength. This takes the usually subtle Glenlivet and makes it more vibrant, amplifying its flavors while accentuating the bourbon oak. Tight notes of honeyed malt, vanilla bean, toasted oak, bright fruit, and nuts, are peppered with more subtle floral and spice notes. Dry, spicy finish. A Glenlivet with pizzazz.",
"Talisker Distillers Edition, 1992 vintage, 45.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Antique amber color. This whisky maintains the elegance cherished by Glenlivet enthusiasts, but finishing the whisky in limousin oak produces a whisky of deeper wood notes, particularly wood spices (vanilla, sandalwood, perhaps even mint) and floral notes. It’s rich, complex, and dry-especially on the finish.",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Tamdhu), Cask # 7313, 34 year old, 1969 vintage, 40.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"Younger bottlings of Glenlivet are often quite elegant and subtle. But such finesse isn’t always evident in older expressions, which often become dominated by sherry and oak. This one, at 35 years of age, demonstrates plenty of elegance and finesse. What impresses me most about this whisky is that you wouldn’t know it was 35 year old just by taste. It isn’t the least bit tired on the palate, and it is very clean, without the excessive woodiness often found in whiskies of this age. Plus, the balance of flavors is impeccable-vanilla, honeyed malt, peaches, pineapple, heather, and just a touch of oak. A very polished, refined whisky.",
"Tomintoul Stillman's Dram 33 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,90,230,101 to 500 Dollars,"Waves of fruit (apple pie, orange marmalade, sultana, ripe pineapple), accented with notes of dark chocolate, roasted nuts, and spice (cinnamon, vanilla, ginger, evergreen), particularly on the finish. (In the past, I’ve thought that a couple of these limited edition Glemorangie wood finishes were a little overdone with the finishing, but not this one).",
"Ardmore 30 year old, 53.7%",Single Malt Scotch,90,450,101 to 500 Dollars,"Style: Highland single malt scotch Color: Golden honey Aroma: Lush and mouthwatering. Notes of honey, peaches in syrup, golden raisins, coconut, vanilla, and background resinous oak. Palate: Creamy and velvety in texture. Honey and fruit up front, with some oak notes, wood resins and vanilla mid-palate, becoming sweet again with a soothing finish.",
"Arran Madeira Wine Cask Finish (2008 Limited Edition), 50%",Single Malt Scotch,90,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Amber gold color. Rich aromas of complex fruit and vanilla. Thick and rich in body, with a mouth-coating texture. Flavors of honeyed malt, well structured fruit, and vanilla, with a long finish. 
",
"The Balvenie Madeira Cask 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Amber color. Lush, rich aromas of rummy toffee, nuts, vanilla, with interwoven notes of glazed fruit. On the heavy side of medium in body, and silky. There are layers of sweetness on the palate (toffee, caramel, marzipan and dates), becoming nutty with a pleasing oak woodiness to balance the sweetness. Long, dryish finish with notes of spice and fruit. 
",
"Glenmorangie Sonnalta PX, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"A new expression due out in March, positioned between the 12 and 18 year old versions. A fresh and enormously drinkable whisky; very silky, with honeyed malt, delicate citrus and berry fruit, floral notes (heather and lavender), and a hint of cocoa and sea spray.",
"Laphroaig 18 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,90,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"Antique amber color. Aromas of toffee and malt, with interwoven dried fruit, flowers, and spices-a real potpourri. Rich, lush body. Rich flavors of toffee, wood resin spices, and citrus, finishing with notes of malt, toffee, and a hint of leather and smoke.",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glen Grant), 1966, 41 year old, 49.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,512,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The seventh limited edition release of Port Ellen whiskies by Diageo. Not as vibrant and intense as younger bottlings (particularly on the nose), but nicely matured with a satisfying sweet foundation. Notes of toffee and roasted nuts permeate though the peat kiln smoke, coal tar, fish nets, and charred oak. Seaweed and brine, more reserved mid-palate, emerges noticeably on the finish. The Port Ellen bottlings are getting older (the distillery closed in 1983) and they are getting more expensive. This one still captures the essence of Port Ellen. 
",
"Old Malt Cask (distilled at Port Ellen), 25 year old, 54.7%",Single Malt Scotch,90,256,101 to 500 Dollars,"Antique gold color. A pleasingly aromatic aroma of dried fruit, floral notes, malt, and light toffee. Medium in body, and slightly chewy. Its flavors are well-balanced, deep, and complex. Toffee, almonds, and sweet malt notes, with interwoven notes of fruit. The palate ultimately dries out with dried fruit, herbs and nuts on the finish. 
",
"Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2009), 57.9%",Single Malt Scotch,90,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured in amoroso casks. The amoroso softens Talisker’s fiery personality and adds a gentle sweetness not normally found in Talisker. There’s a lot going on here-notes of toffee and dark chocolate, layered with bitter orange, seaweed, kippers, smoked nuts, damp peat, and kalamata olives, finishing with a peppery glow. Not an every day dram-one has to be in the mood for a whisky like this. (With sausages during brunch, perhaps?) 
",
"Signatory (distilled at Port Ellen), 1982 vintage, 26 year old (Cask # 1202), 54.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,275,101 to 500 Dollars,"A whisky that defies its age. It is remarkably clean and fresh, with no suggestion of excessive oak. Fragrant aroma, with notes of vanilla, coconut, honeyed malt, cereal grain, and linseed. Similar follow through on the palate, with a texture that is soft, lightly oily, and soothing. Clean finish. One of the best Tamdhu whiskies I’ve tasted. 
",
"Kilchoman, Autumn 2009 release, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,76,0 to 100 Dollars,"Antique gold color. Fragrant aroma, with floral notes, soft honey tones, vanilla, and delicate fruit (orange and lemon). Light to medium in body and soft in texture. Flavors are similar to the whisky's aroma, very clean, and with great balance-the woody notes one would expect from a whisky this old are kept in check.",
"Ardbeg Supernova (2010 Release), 60.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"The oldest Ardmore I have tasted. Smartly bottled at cask strength and not chill-filtered. (The entry level Ardmore “Traditional” is at the opposite end of the age spectrum, tasting quite youthful.) My initial concern with this 30 year old was: would the wood dominate the lovely floral, smoky notes I enjoy so much with Ardmore? The wood is certainly present, but the smoke still comes through. There’s a gently layered sweetness that complements the smoke (toffee, deep caramel, subtle honey), licorice root, bourbon barrel char, coffee grounds, and high cocoa chocolate, with subtle dried citrus and a suggestion of floral soap. Dry finish, with more bourbon barrel char and licorice root. Considering that Ardmore has historically been a blending malt, most of the stocks right now are much younger. This is a rare treat. It’s a wee bit thin in body and a little on the dry side from 30 years on wood for me to rate it in the mid 90s, but it’s still a very enjoyable whisky.",
"anCnoc Vintage 2001, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"New to Glen Moray’s core range, this was initially matured in bourbon barrels before finishing in port pipes. The nose is fragrant and inviting, with raspberries, ginger, vanilla custard, and sultanas. Voluptuous in the mouth, with honey, cherry liqueur, coconut, marzipan, and milk chocolate vying with contrasting dried fruit and wood notes. The chocolate darkens in the finish, with raisins, licorice, and slightly tannic oak. (4,000 bottles; 1,200 for U.S.)",
"GlenDronach 1990 vintage 20 year old Oloroso (cask 2621), 57.9%",Single Malt Scotch,90,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"A harmonious marriage of fruit and spice. More balanced than last year’s sweet Rum Cask release. In fact, this is one of the most deftly-balanced whiskies I’ve tasted this year. Bramble, ripe nectarine, caramel apple, honeyed vanilla, and golden raisin, spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg. Soft (for Balvenie), lingering, warm, dried spice finish.",
"Mackillop's Choice (distilled at Mortlach), 22 year old, 1982 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Soothing and seamless on the nose and palate with chewy toffee, molasses, nougat, almond butter, vanilla fudge, cinnamon spice, and nutmeg, along with gentle tobacco notes emerging later on the palate. A pleasing dry finish offsets the sweeter notes. A delicious whisky from beginning to end.",
"Glenglassaugh, 26 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,260,101 to 500 Dollars,"Very smooth for Laphroaig -- the extra aging has mellowed this whisky. Soothing honeyed malt, creamy vanilla, and toffee provide a bed for peat smoke, charcoal, and tar; along with more subtle brine, smoked seaweed, anise, ginger, and citrus. A gentler, creamier, more tactile, less medicinal Laphroaig when compared to some of its siblings. Will you prefer the new 18 year old to the 15 year old it is replacing? That depends. I enjoy the balance and subtle complexity of flavors with the 15 year old, but I also like the enhanced richness and mouth-coating creaminess of the 18. The higher strength (and no chill-filtering) of the 18 is certainly a bonus. (Side note: I know this is a moot point now, but I would like to have seen the 15 year old bottled at 48%, rather than 43%.)",
"Glengoyne Christmas Cask, 60.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,155,101 to 500 Dollars,"There have been a lot of old, heavily sherried, independently bottled Glen Grant whiskies on the market over the past several years. This one appears to be from a refill sherry cask, as its influence is more subtle. It has aged well, showing no excessive oak, but plenty of fruit (summer fruits, dried citrus, stewed fruits, tangerine, golden raisin), balanced by polished oak, grape skin, and subtle dark chocolate. Distinctively pleasing. Don’t add too much water, though, as it breaks down. (A Kensington Wine Market exclusive.) $500 (CAD)",
"The Macallan Easter Elchies, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,185,101 to 500 Dollars,"These Port Ellen whiskies are becoming increasingly rare since the distillery closed down for good in 1983. This is a very good example of an old-fashioned Islay whisky: never heavy, but with lots of kick. There’s plenty of wet leaf, bonfire smoke, coal tar, and some earthy, damp kiln notes and brine. But you’ll discover a lovely honeyed maltiness for balance, along with tangerine, dirty martini, and cocoa for complexity. Smoky, briny finish. There will be a time when some of us will tell the next generation of whisky drinkers about the joys of Port Ellen. Mare sure you’re one of those telling the story, not listening to it. (Exclusive to Kensington Wine Market.) $250 (Canadian)",
"Talisker 30 year old, 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,349,101 to 500 Dollars,"The aromas are tightly bound, but a little water releases them nicely. A powerful dram, with tarry, leafy, coal ash, caramel apple, and driftwood notes; even a little soapy (not necessarily a negative). More subtle floral notes (heather, violet), Earl Grey tea, and smoked fish. Long, damp peat smoke and charcoal finish.",
"Port Charlotte PC7 7 year old (Cask #1215), 63.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Port Ellen, for sure! Very old-fashioned in nature: intertwined notes of tarry rope, coal soot, rooty peat, toffee, dark chocolate, and walnuts, spiked with coffee bean, anise, cracked peppercorn, and a hint of ginger. Dry, smoky, long, slightly austere finish. This Port Ellen is a bit moody (maybe even has an attitude problem), but I’m not complaining.",
"Gordon & MacPhail Generations: Glenlivet 70 year old, 45.9%",Single Malt Scotch,90,21000,10001 and above,"This (rather young) Islay distillery’s second release. Like the first, it’s aged for about three years and then finished in sherry casks—this time for a shorter two and a half months. Its flavor is similar to the first release.
Once again, I am quite impressed. It’s very mature for its age, with good viscosity, showing smoldering peat, coal tar, black licorice stick, burnt dark berried fruit, thick-cut marmalade, shoo-fly pie (think molasses), toffee apple, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and a suggestion of wet sheep. Long, peat smoke finish.£47
",
"Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection: Glenlivet Decades 1963, 40.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,1230,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Very dynamic, complex, and powerful. Here’s what I’m picking up, in somewhat descending order in taste profile: leafy smoke, coal tar, mocha fudge with dark chocolate chips, smoked olive, peppered seaweed salad, fruit (lemon, lime), genever, brine-tinged grass, and (with some coaxing) floral notes (violet?). Compared to last year’s debut release of Supernova, this one is certainly comparable, but I feel it’s a tad richer, with more leafy smoke and ripe barley. It also seems a bit more polished, less aggressive. I like it a little more than its predecessor (rated 89).",
"Fettercairn Fior, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,90,59,0 to 100 Dollars,"Similar to Laphroaig Quarter Cask, but also finished in oloroso sherry casks. Fruit and smoke: fleshy red berries, red licorice, toffee, ripe barley, coal tar, sun-baked seaweed, peat smoke, and a hint of coffee grounds. Tarry finish. I rated the Quarter Cask a 91, and I think this whisky is similar in quality. If you like sherry-influenced whiskies, then go for the Triple Wood. If not, then consider the Quarter Cask. (Travel Retail and European exclusive)",
"Berry Bros. & Rudd, distilled at Balmenach, 1979, 56.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,232,101 to 500 Dollars,"If every fan of sherried whisky has a favorite GlenDronach then this is a long way down the road to being mine. It has a dusty dried orange peel, powdery, and perfumey nose, a soft and sweet round palate with a dark chocolate, tangerine, and pink grapefruit heart, and a balanced and gentle finish. This was probably once a hollerin’ maned lion of a malt, but it’s grown old gracefully and it now purrs and growls beautifully. £80 ",
"Benromach 30 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,240,101 to 500 Dollars,"The fruit (orange marmalade, tangerine, fresh pineapple) is nearly as dominant as the leafy smoke. Sweet notes of nutty caramel, honeyed barley, toffee, and nougat round out the palate. Ginger, cinnamon, telicherry pepper, tobacco, and ash play a supporting role. Lingering fruity, smoky finish. For those who like sherried Islay whiskies.",
"Strathisla 16 year old, 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,59,0 to 100 Dollars,"A polished whisky, light-medium in body with well-rounded flavors. Fruity (ripe orange, lemon gumdrops, candy apple), with creamy vanilla and a honeyed, toasted malt foundation. Soft, gentle oak throughout. What a lovely, gentle-natured whisky, straight down the middle! Bonus points for versatility. ",
"Bruichladdich 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,57,0 to 100 Dollars,"Credit to Glengoyne for coming up with something different. There are just 100 bottles of this malt available this year, with a further 100 or so released each Christmas from the same cask each year until 2014, effectively offering malt enthusiasts the chance to plot a work in progress. Better still, this first effort is one of the best releases ever to come out of the distillery. The name is spot on; it really is Christmas in a glass, with the almost feminine aromas of rosewater, flowers, candy stick, and fruit giving way to a huge sherry note on the palate. Dark chocolate, cherry, orange, and chili notes combine to offer up a bold and full malt. Some special bottlings from Glengoyne have been over-oaky or marred by sulfur, but not this one. This is clean, pure, and classy. Can’t wait to see where it goes next.",
"Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection (distilled at Old Pulteney) 1994 vintage (Cask #06/125), 45%",Single Malt Scotch,89,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Bright gold color. Soft aromas and flavors of delicate honey, heather, subtle spice, tropical fruit, creamy vanilla, and malt. Nicely balanced throughout the palate and very clean-this whisky was aged in an excellent cask. There are no off flavor notes from the wood at all, nor is it too woody on the finish. Rather, it finishes soft, gentle, and clean.",
"Berry Brothers & Rudd (distilled at Glen Grant) 1972 37 year old, 51.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,289,101 to 500 Dollars,"For me, Talisker 30 year olds have paled in comparison to the same distillery’s 20 and 25 year olds. This, however, immediately shows promise. Gold in color, and while it’s another one that starts ever so slightly restrained, the giveaway peppery note soon reveals itself as smoked pimento and Szechuan pepper, mixed with extra virgin olive oil spread over hot smoked salmon. There’s also a touch of putty — something which you usually only see in youthful expressions — suggesting that here’s another refill maturation. 
As with many of these older whiskies, water isn’t the best option for the palate, but a drop does help release the sweet fruitiness that always lurks in Talisker’s heart, this time accompanied by an herbal note (mint and fennel). It’s almost as if it is looking back at itself as an 18 year old, but here the firm granitic grip of age takes hold.
The palate starts slowly but opens well with a gentle, yet assertive revealing of the aromas on the nose. It seems to dip in energy just in the center before sparking back to life when the smoke emerges, like the last flash of defiance from an old-timer. ",
"Duncan Taylor Peerless (distilled at Glenrothes) 1969 41 year old, 44.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,330,101 to 500 Dollars,"A single cask from the distillery’s peated “Port Charlotte” line of whiskies. Well behaved for such youth. Nice honeyed malt and soft caramel base with good viscosity as a bed for tarry peat, licorice stick, freshly-ground pepper, and cocoa, along with a kiss of sauternes, delicate pit fruit, smoked seaweed, and a lingering coastal accent. Long, warming finish. (Park Avenue Liquor exclusive)",
"Gordon & MacPhail 41 year old 1970 (distilled at Macallan), 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,700,501 to 1000 Dollars,"You would expect any 70 year old whisky to be crepuscular, dense, and wooded. Not here. The nose is amazingly fresh — distillery character fully intact — with layers of rancio and heavy florals. In time, there’s candle wax, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a touch of leather, even the whiff of a soft mink stole. Concentrated and complex. The palate is like an ancient vin santo with oxidized nuttiness, quince and medlar, and subtle peat. Hugely expressive on the palate, with a sweet finish. Truly remarkable.",
"Glenglassaugh 35 Year Old The Chosen Few, 49.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,471,101 to 500 Dollars,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. A first-fill American oak hoggie was the receptacle for the representative from the 1960s. The cask has provided an extremely relaxed environment for maturation to take place, with a return of the pineapple (grilled on a barbecue this time), along with linden blossom, cream, green jasmine tea, and mint. The effect is like a grown up 1991. The maturity kicks in on the palate — thick and slow with some sandalwood alongside honeysuckle. Gentle and clean, and again not one to dilute. £750",
"Johnnie Walker Double Black, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"Released with no age statement, Fettercairn Fior contains 15 percent heavily-peated whisky matured in first-fill ex-bourbon barrels, along with a proportion of 14 and 15 year old spirit. The result is a bold and complex whisky with real nose presence; smoke, sherry, toffee, vanilla, and oranges merge on the nose, while the palate showcases more smoke and toffee, plus spices, oak, and licorice in the lengthy finish. £36 Not currently available in the U.S.",
"Highland Park 12 Year Old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,90,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"Although one of the old Speyside crew (along with Mortlach, Glenfarclas, and Macallan) Balmenach has, inexplicably in my mind, never even achieved cult status. It has simply kept on making rich, powerful, worm tub-condensed spirit for a multitude of blends. This rare bottling therefore is hugely welcome and shows a friskier than usual side — earthy for sure and a lick of leather as well, but also walnut and sultana. The palate is deep and languorous with a savory edge. £145 (Not available in the U.S.)",
"Glen Garioch 1986, 54.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,185,101 to 500 Dollars,"We had some new Benromachs from Gordon & MacPhail last issue that illustrated what the firm has been up to since it purchased the site in 1992. This release comes from its previous incarnation as part of DCL. The elegant, mature nose shows an ‘Old Speyside’ light smokiness alongside barley, cacao, cigar humidor, and potpourri. The palate is gentle and unctuous with some sherried touches, while the smoke reruns on the very end. £150 (Not available in the U.S.)",
"Compass Box Last Vatted Malt, 53.7%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,287,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is one of a trio from Chivas Bros., who every year release limited editions of 500 ml cask strength bottlings from a selection of its estates. These are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.

My pick of this batch. Strathisla’s a small, traditional distillery whose make is mostly pressed into service for the Chivas Regal blends. It’s a hard to pin down malt, and it’s this elusive character that shows here: firm then soft, fragrant then deep. The nose is intense and spicy with wax, nougat, chocolate, hazelnut, and fresh-opened banana. The palate is explosive with real presence and power, whose firm core is softened by honey and poached fruits. Complex is the word. £37",
"Glenfarclas Family Cask 1971 (Cask #3546), 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,540,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The first 10 year old distilled by the current owners back in 2001. Lovely marriage of both bourbon and sherry casks, and quite fresh, with a maturity resembling a 12 year old, rather than 10. Smooth on the palate and very drinkable, with creamy vanilla, honeycomb, banana bread, bright lemon, melon (honeydew, cantaloupe), tangerine, candied ginger, and delicate brine. With all the Bruichladdich razzle-dazzle over the past decade, we can embrace this unpretentiously delicious Laddie with open arms.",
"Glenfarclas Family Cask 1996 (Cask #1306), 55.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,270,101 to 500 Dollars,"Recently bottled by Duncan Taylor in their non-colored, non-chill filtered NC2 range, this 13 year old expression of Springbank initially exhibits tinned pears on the nose, then smoked fish cooked in butter, coconut oil, brine, and a hint of lemon. More sweet wood smoke with time, turning to char. The palate opens with profound, sweet fruit, swiftly followed by salt, lime, and medicinal notes. Lingering, with ginger in the pleasantly oaky finish. £64",
"Talisker 10 year old, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is quite different from the Adelphi Glen Grant bottling (below), being more cask-driven, but Glen Grant’s clean fruitiness remains, although transformed by age. Its apples are baked, with some added caramelized juices thrown in; we see apricot alongside dried lemon peel, and light, sweet spice. The waxiness here is akin to leather oil, while the oak has sufficient grip to give structure. In time, there are hints of the cellar — burlap and wet earth. Delicious, and best neat. £184",
"Highland Park Thor 16 year old, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Immediately you can tell this is a complex, old, mature whisky — that hint of rancio is there, but there’s more of a beeswax character than on the Adelphi bottling (below), along with the peachiness that often appears in old drams. This is balanced by light coconut, even a hint of grist. The waxiness seen on the nose allows it to cling to the tongue, while the fruits become jellied. Benefits from a drop of water, allowing lemon and vanilla to show. £210",
"Royal Salute 21 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,170,101 to 500 Dollars,"On more familiar ground with this G&M bottling of one of Speyside’s most iconic single malts, this is Macallan in full-on sherried form. Highly aromatic with powdered clove, hints of incense and fig, behind which is cacao, Bolivar cigar, and molasses. The palate has immediate smoke and surprisingly gentle tannins — the inherent oiliness of the spirit keeping any grip at bay. Very long, leathery, prune-like (think armagnac), and dense. A classic after-dinner mouth-filler.",
"Caol Ila 12 year old Feis Ile bottling 2012, 60.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,133,101 to 500 Dollars,"The initial release in Glenglassaugh’s new ‘The Chosen Few’ range has been picked by customer accounts manager Ronnie Routledge. It was distilled in 1976 and matured in an ex-sherry butt that yielded 654 bottles. Initially, an aroma of Black Twist tobacco and treacle, with sweeter and more floral notes following on. Significant honey influence. Mouth-coating, with sweet sherry and tropical fruits, plus developing honey and spice notes. Oak, toast, and dark chocolate in the lingering, lively finish. £300",
"The Dalmore 1979 33 year old, 48.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,8000,5001 to 10000 Dollars,"So how brave can you be? Would you take one of the world's most iconic blends and risk messing with it? If you've got a whisky maker as good as Jim Beveridge, then why not? This picks up from the regular JW Black and its signature Caol Ila smoke and peat heart and then adds to it, doing exactly what it says on the tin. But the clever part of this is upping the apple, orange, and fruit content too. Great. ",
"Clan Denny Islay, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"Highland Park 12 Year Old boasts individuality and complexity, thanks in part to the use of Orcadian peat in the distillery floor maltings and the employment of ex-sherry casks for maturation. The nose is fragrant and floral, with hints of heather and some spice. Smooth and honeyed on the palate, with citrus fruits, malt, and distinctive tones of wood smoke in the warm, lengthy, slightly peaty finish.",
"The Balvenie Tun 1401 (Batch #5), 50.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"This latest vintage release from Glen Garioch is a cask strength 25 year old. It follows on from previous ‘small-batch’ 1978, 1990, 1991, and 1994 vintages. Peaches and ginger on the nose, with fudge and a wisp of smoke. Mildly herbal. Full-bodied, rich, and sweet in the mouth. Fresh fruit and violet creams. Finally a slightly earthy, peaty note. The finish is long and gently smoky. Robust, yet refined.",
"The Dalmore Ceti 30 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,90,1980,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Not Compass Box at the very top of its game, but pretty damn good nevertheless. This is a mix of malts from different distilleries and it has the company's distinctive DNA all over it, combining siege cannon-strength peated malt with rich, fruity, sherried whisky. It's clumsier than the wonderful Flaming Heart but in the same ballpark, and I have to declare an interest — I adore this combination when it's delivered right. £180 ",
"Duncan Taylor The Big Smoke 60, 60%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"Sherry butt once more, but this is much more relaxed in its attentions — think Montgomery Clift seducing Elizabeth Taylor rather than De Niro chatting up Liza Minelli. Sweetness is the key here, gentle and slightly caramelized, with touches of molasses-like concentration and even a whiff of the top of a crème brûlée. The palate surprises with its continued freshness; apple and the distillery’s distinctive earthy richness. Great balance.£382",
"Big Peat, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"The youngest of this Family Cask selection shows Glenfarclas in a surprisingly citric light, with plenty of citrus peels — tangerine, marmalade, and orange syrup, as well as sultana, suede, wax polish (surprising in a youngish dram), and chocolate — a recurring theme here. It is almost as if all the more lifted elements in each of the previous casks have here united. Mature, but highly expressive, and a great starter. £172",
"Adelphi 14 year old 1997 (distilled at Macallan), 51.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,117,101 to 500 Dollars,"Another that should need no introduction. The thing to look for in Talisker, as with all smoky whiskies, is sweetness that gives the requisite balance to the drying effect of smoke. Underneath Talisker’s smoke, which ain't as all-pervading as Lagavulin, is a sweet pear-like quality. When young there are notes of the land: heather, moor, sweet seaweed, and a finish that has a distinctive cracked black pepper hit.",
"The Macallan Ruby, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,187,101 to 500 Dollars,"Thor is the first in Highland Park’s new cask strength Valhalla Collection, with a fresh expression inspired by the Nordic gods due to be released annually over the next four years. Ginger, sherry, Christmas spices, wood smoke, vanilla, and a hint of lemon on the complex, confident nose. Notably spicy in the mouth, with peaches, clotted cream, sherry, and more smoke. Long in the finish, with lots of ginger, a little aniseed, and finally, spicy peat.",
"Adelphi 12 year old 2000 vintage  (distilled at Bowmore), 56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,92,0 to 100 Dollars,"Not exactly a new whisky for the Jubilee, just a new pack, but it’s a good enough excuse to have a look at this top-end blend. Great maturity with masses of orchard fruits and a hint of passion fruit as well. The oak is rounded and supple while with water a banana note is released. Thick and chewy, with more grip than suggested on the nose and a little nut on the finish. Great blending. ",
"Glenmorangie Ealanta Private Edition, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,119,101 to 500 Dollars,"Often overshadowed by other noisier neighbors, it is time to reconsider Caol Ila—and this is a fine place to start. Coming from a refill cask it has a nose of sweet crab, ham with cider glaze, and teasing maritime smoke. The palate mixes salt taffy with top-end peppery olive oil, allowing the flavors to cover the palate while the smoke rumbles along constantly before a salt-laden finish. Superlative balance. Find one of those 620 bottles! £85	",
"Jura 1977 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,900,501 to 1000 Dollars,"This expression of The Dalmore Constellation spent its entire 33 years of maturation in an ex-bourbon cask, with no additional finishing. The result is a nose of ripe peaches and pears, honey, and vanilla. Full-bodied, rich, sweet, elegant, yet substantial on the palate, with pineapples and fudge. Oak and aniseed slowly build, but the wood is held at bay. Long and warming in the finish, with soft spices. Barely drying. Cask number 594; 199 bottles.",
"Glen Garioch 1991, 54.7%",Single Malt Scotch,89,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Interestingly, this whisky was bottled in 2005, but not released until the end of 2008. (The brand manager tells me that they wanted to wait until the stocks of the current 1980s vintage (a 1987) were depleted. It’s fresh, lively, and uncluttered, glowing with bright fruit (mandarin orange, nectarine), lemon meringue pie, and a creamy vanilla sweetness that coats the palate. A gently dry oak finish with subtle anise and very dark chocolate. A perky Glenrothes, and a lot of fun to drink. 
",
"Cutty Sark Prohibition, 50%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,30,0 to 100 Dollars,"So soon? This latest release of what is becoming a legendary series mixes nine casks—four butts, five hoggies—from between 1966 and 1990. Hugely complex and obviously mature, it is one to sit and smell forever. Marzipan, mocha, pain au chocolat, manuka honey; every sniff reveals another aroma. It opens into cigar, sandalwood, citrus, and ripe black fruits. The palate is equally layered and expansive. It takes water, but only a drop, for that density is all-important.",
"Glen Grant Five Decades, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,177,101 to 500 Dollars,"The Dalmore spirit that comprises Ceti comes from a mix of bourbon and sherry casks, with bourbon wood predominating. 23 years of maturation in American oak were followed by seven years in 30 year old Gonzalez Byass Matusalem oloroso sherry butts. The result is a nose of old leather, hessian, sandalwood, vanilla, plain chocolate, and ripe Jaffa oranges. Very full-bodied, with burnt orange, pineapple, and sticky toffee, while the finish offers ginger, orange wine gums, and old oak. 1,000 bottles. £1,250",
"Adelphi (distilled at Mortlach) 25 year old, 59.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,157,101 to 500 Dollars,"Does it do exactly what it says on the tin? You betcha! This is big, and it's smoky, and if you're a fan of Islay malts, then it's right up your street. There's more to it than just smoke, though. There's stewed apple on the nose as well as steam engine oil, and on the palate there's gooseberry, spearmint, and apple pip. But as you'd expect, the peat lingers. ",
"The Balvenie Tun 1401 (Batch #9), 49.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"So which independent bottler comes out in the 'Big' battle of the Islay blended malts? Given this is bottled at a lower strength and it's at a lower price, I'm calling it a draw. The latest batch of this is the best yet, with Ardbeg, Caol Ila, and Bowmore the main components, although there is also some Port Ellen in the mix. So you know what to expect—and it doesn't disappoint. Big AND peaty.",
"Glenrothes Minister’s Reserve, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,188,101 to 500 Dollars,"Here is Macallan in full-blown masculine mode. Initially it seems tight and (sherry) cask driven, but soon you are taken into a winter kitchen with scents of venison, and appropriate rowanberry edges adding a sweet and sour fruitiness. That wild berry note is given another nudge by a whiff of burning juniper. The palate shows it to be thick with a quivering mass of black fruits, and a finish of molasses and licorice. A feast. £75",
"Bruichladdich Islay Barley 2007 6 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,90,72,0 to 100 Dollars,"Rooted in the earth and redolent of late autumn. There’s a plummy thread that runs through this range; here we’ve gone to prune, mixed with dried cherries, and a sweet/savory edge whose whiff of heavy rose petal is reminiscent of Barolo. Robust, yet sweet. Heady, like chocolate-covered Turkish Delight. The palate has oloroso notes alongside Assam-like tannins. One to have with water on the side. Classical in structure and aromatics, but that vinous sweetness is new. £120",
"Bowmore Devil’s Casks 10 year old, 56.9%",Single Malt Scotch,90,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"There’s a fascinating journey taking place here. The nose takes you indoors; caramelized tropical fruits, coffee cake, a spent fire in the grate, and just the merest whiff of the waves hitting the beach. The palate, however, places you squarely aboard a yacht under sail: salt spray, deck and engine oil, worn leather upholstery. It seems way more mature than 12 years. The intensity is lost with water, but you gain more smoke. A great bottling.  ",
"Compass Box Delilah's, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Ealanta is the fourth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition series, and has been aged in heavily-charred virgin white oak casks from Missouri for nineteen years. The result is a nose of American cream soda, milk chocolate, fudge, pineapple, and honey; spicy and creamy. Silky smooth in the mouth, with brittle toffee and orange notes; gently herbal, with a suggestion of cloves and newly-sawn wood. Long in the finish, with citrus fruit, oak, aniseed, and an enduring spicy creaminess.",
"Blue Hanger 9th Release, 45.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,115,101 to 500 Dollars,"This vintage expression from Jura has been matured in three first-fill bourbon casks and then finished for one year in a ruby port pipe. Just 498 bottles have been released. Apricots, pineapple, caramel, butterscotch, sultanas, and white chocolate on the nose. The palate is warm and spicy, with subtle pine and citrus fruits, along with coconut and a hint of peat. Long in the finish with more vanilla before dried fruits and oak kick in. The delicate peat remains.",
"Convalmore 36 year old, 58%",Single Malt Scotch,90,936,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Quite fragrant, with a thick, oily texture. Sweet notes (vanilla, sticky toffee), ripe barley, earthy peat, licorice root, and a hint of melon and citrus. Very clean and characterful. A lot of fun to drink. Nicely done! I can’t imagine a 14 year old Glen Garioch tasting any better than this. (A Julio’s Liquor Exclusive) ",
"The Dalmore 25 year old, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,90,975,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The Real McCoy! It's said that during Prohibition Bill McCoy serviced the better speakeasies with proper Cutty Sark; hence the name. If this is a recreation of what they might have been drinking back then, you can see why they kept fighting over it. This is another bold, earthy, smoky blend with oily, industrial notes. There's crabapple, smoke, bitter lemon, grapefruit, and even black currant. It would seem blended whisky is where it's at right now! Great stuff.  ",
"Glenglassaugh 40 year old, 42.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,2000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Created by Dennis Malcolm to celebrate his half century at Glen Grant, this uses casks
from each of his five decades. Pale it may be, but this is no dainty little
thing. There’s lots of buttery oak before classic Glen Grant lift and energy
emerge: green apple, fruit blossom, William pear, and yellow fruits; lemon
butter icing and nettles with water. The palate is vibrant and energetic, but
holds to the middle of the tongue. A suitably celebratory dram.
Congratulations! £115",
"BenRiach Septendecim 17 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Rich amber in hue, sweet, and mellow with initial amontillado sherry notes that give way to Mortlach meatiness; here a lamb tagine with prune, apricot, and gravy juices. This elegance gives way to a fascinating palate mix of the sweet and the savory with citrus, sultana, and a rowanberry jab on the end mingling with just a bit of smoke. Everything mellowed by time and oak. Very good indeed. £99",
"Mortlach Rare Old, 43.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,93,0 to 100 Dollars,"This latest installment of the Tun 1401 series is a classic expression of old, mature Balvenie, where a waxiness akin to furniture polish slides into mead-like aromas; actually more like metheglin, as there’s an herbal, spiced element. Its textural richness means it is best with water on the side, allowing deep earthy, licorice, and cigar ash tones to develop, along with just the lightest squeeze of tannin. (U.S. only.)",
"Mortlach Special Strength, 49%",Single Malt Scotch,90,127,101 to 500 Dollars,"The oldest of a new three-strong range from Glenrothes called the Manse Brae series; the youngest component here is 21 years old. Serious and lightly meaty, the savory characters come at you, mixing gun smoke with cypress, sandalwood, dark chocolate, and dunnage warehouse. The headiness of moist forest floor continues on the tongue along with a burst of honeyed peach. Moving in many directions simultaneously…and slowly. Keep this neat. Classic Rothes. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €140",
"Springbank 21 year old 2014 release, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,307,101 to 500 Dollars,"Using barley grown on Rockside Farm, this is fresh, sweet (agave syrup), delicate, and lightly buttery, with touches of lily of the valley and lemon sponge cake mix. The cereal character is restrained, with a charred hint on the palate along with banana, mandarin, cassia, and pink marshmallows (untoasted). The Laddie’s floral notes emerge late, and the whiff of white pepper on the end is all there is to remind you of its youth. A classy young whisky. £45",
"Glenmorangie Companta, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,99,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured in first-fill sherry casks, here we have Bowmore at its ballsiest, with massively bold notes of prune, dried fig, salted treacle, toffee, shoe leather, rose petal, and savory maritime edges that glance toward Marmite, all of which are infiltrated by clouds of smoke. The palate has retained sweetness, mixing black cherry, pipe tobacco, and cloves. Powerful and seriously impressive with fantastic balance that retains Bowmore identity, adds richness, ups the peatiness, and leaves you under Satan’s spell.",
"Glen Deveron 30 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,90,422,101 to 500 Dollars,"A special bottling in recognition of Chicago's outstanding alternative rock venue Delilah's, and like that venue this is full of character, color, grit, and determination. It's sweet but never cloying, soft and honeyed but gutsy, and there are peppermint, licorice, and fresh hay notes in the mix, too. It's spent time in bourbon wood and that shows. A departure for Compass Box, but a healthy one.",
"Glenfarclas Family Casks 1990 (Cask #1362), 51.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,379,101 to 500 Dollars,"You have to take your hat off to Berry Bros. & Rudd’s Doug McIvor, who is whisky's answer to Bruce Springsteen: consistently brilliant, complex, spanning the generations, and in the form of his life. This just doesn't let up, with plenty of smoke and peat in the mix, but with citrus fruits, some plummy depths, and a vanilla cushion. It’s balanced perfectly. Born to run? You betcha.",
"Bowmore 15 year old Laimrig, 53.7%",Single Malt Scotch,90,118,101 to 500 Dollars,"The last official Convalmore remains one of my top whiskies. Here is a different meditation on age. There’s soft leather, coal smoke, and polished brass. The distillery’s waxiness is a spent candle in a deserted chapel, the harvest festival fruits wrinkling on the altar. Amazingly, in the mouth a shaft of honeyed sunlight comes through to transform the scene into one of life. Everything glows, the wax returns, and then, with the smoke increasing, the light fades. Old, and fascinating. (2,980 bottles)",
"Glengoyne 25 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,90,421,101 to 500 Dollars,"Dalmore 25 year old comprises spirit matured initially in American oak casks, some of which is then transferred into first-fill bourbon barrels, while the remainder goes into Palomino fino sherry butts. The two batches are then reunited in bourbon barrels before a final finishing in tawny port pipes. Vanilla, figs, toffee, and ripe oranges on the festive nose, while the palate features more orange, peaches, milk chocolate, and sherry. The chocolate darkens in the lengthy finish, with ginger and licorice.",
"The Lost Distilleries Blend (Batch Four), 50.9%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,587,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Glenglassaugh has altered its policy of offering single cask expressions of its 40 year old, and replaced these with a vatting of casks to provide an ongoing release program, offered at cask strength and without chill filtration. The nose is pleasingly complex, with ginger, honey, milk chocolate, icing sugar, sherry, plums, and new leather. Resinous on the palate, with pineapple and brittle toffee, then black coffee and aniseed. A spicy oakiness ultimately develops. Drying steadily in the finish, with licorice and oak tannins. £1,200",
"Adelphi (distilled at Mortlach) 26 year old, 58.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,295,101 to 500 Dollars,"No hiding that this is one of BenRiach’s peated variants, with smoke coming at you like an out of control garden bonfire, but the inherent sweetness of the distillery character adds a counterpoint: cinnamon-dusted apples baking in the fire, before angelica and cannabis (someone tells me) come through. The interplay between fruits and grassy smoke continues on the palate alongside toffee, nougat, peach syrup, and salty licorice before the smoke returns. A belter. And a great price.",
"Craigellachie 13 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,53,0 to 100 Dollars,"The introductory expression of the range shows a further example of the widening of the Mortlach style. Stewed and dried fruits mingle with light earth notes, wet Labrador, supple shoe leather, and varnish. A drop of water is all that’s needed to add a savory element and even some funky fruitiness reminiscent of cooking agave. The palate is big and chocolaty with some meat underneath. Hefty but elegant. The distillery character is not only intact, but enhanced. £55/500 ml",
"Caol Ila 30 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,700,501 to 1000 Dollars,"This is Rare Old at higher strength for folks who haunt Travel Retail outlets. The upping of strength also changes the dynamic, making things sweeter with mushed berries and Seville orange, but also deeper, with more overt meatiness, stewed tea, and the same varnished note. Dense, thick, stewed orchard fruits are on the palate alongside some acetone and, with water, burning rosemary and dry licorice. Similar, but with more heft. £75/500 ml",
"Port Charlotte Islay Barley 2008, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,90,87,0 to 100 Dollars,"The latest limited release of 21 year old Springbank has been matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Sherry and bourbon notes are well integrated on the early nose, which follows up with succulent tropical fruits, toffee, and a whiff of earthy peat. The palate is complex, confident, and oily, with dry sherry notes, almonds, figs, vanilla, wood smoke, and a hint of the sea. The lengthy finish boasts caramel, cinnamon, brine, and soft peat. £182",
"Scotch Malt Whisky Society Berber Whiskey With a Hint of Smoke 53.199 12 year old, 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Companta—Gaelic for friendship—is the fifth of Glenmorangie’s Private Edition releases. It comprises a blend of whiskies finished in Clos de Tart Grand Cru wine casks and in fortified wine casks from Côtes du Rhône. Big fruity, leathery notes on the nose. Spicy, with sultanas, almonds, and icing sugar. The palate is rich and complex, with cocoa powder, nutmeg, more leather, and redcurrants. Long and fruity in the finish, with vibrant spices. Red berries predominate.",
"Compass Box The Lost Blend, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Initially, the nose is very different than that of the younger Glen Deverons, with brown paper and malt vinegar. Becoming buttery, with coconut ice and citrus fruit. Ultimately, a caramel note reminiscent of the 16 year old (see below). Rich and waxy on the palate, with dark berry fruits, almonds, vanilla, and treacle. Sweet and sour. The medium-length finish offers green berries and a hint of aniseed. Real depth of flavor and individuality here. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain.   £250/700 ml",
"The Pearls of Scotland (distilled at Invergordon) 1972, 43.4%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,246,101 to 500 Dollars,"Although the youngest of the range, this has still spent 24 years in a refill butt.  The nose is highly concentrated, with freshly-sharpened pencils and black cherry. There’s also some tobacco and then an earthy, armagnac-esque pruniness. Water brings out a resinous element, supple leather, and fruit syrups, allowing it to retain complexity. The driest of the range with the most obvious grip; for lovers of big, sherried, malts. £225",
"Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Glenrothes) 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,104,101 to 500 Dollars,"This Bowmore has been finished in sherry casks, but without allowing the exuberance of the cask to overwhelm the dram. Instead, there’s concentrated stone fruits, lifted smoke, dried mint, dark chocolate, bitter orange peels, and some smoke. There’s a teasing hint on the tongue of tropical fruits, then a deepening mix of plump dried figs and sultana. Long, layered, with the smoke seamlessly involved, adding accents rather than fogging up proceedings. (Whisky Shop chain only) £70",
"Cutty Sark Art Deco Limited Edition 33 year old, 41.7%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,989,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The latest addition to Glengoyne’s permanent range is a 25 year old, matured in European oak sherry casks and presented in non-chill filtered format. Syrup-like on the nose, very sweet, with milk chocolate, ginger, Jaffa oranges, and sticky toffee pudding. Smooth and sweet on the palate, with overt sherry, sultanas, and gentle spice. The finish is medium to long, with a hint of oak, old leather, and lingering cloves. Bold, yet elegant. £250",
"SIA, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"An enticing blend of aged single malt and grain whiskies from silent stills, top-dressed with Port Ellen. The nose has soft fudge, rosehip, and honey lozenges, with a thread of peat sewn through it. A distinct smokiness hangs above the glass. A mouthful exudes lemon sherbet, honey-drizzled melon, and white chocolate, peaking with raspberry and mixed peel before a conclusion of banana-layered banoffee pie. An elegant finish of baked lemon and sweet oak. One for reflection. £350",
"Big Peat Christmas Edition 2014, 55.7%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Amber. Very meaty, with a touch of cordite, then dark fruits, wet earth, and autumn woods, cut with spicy licorice and Darjeeling tea. Water brings down this exuberance, adding iris and whole grain bread. The palate has typical, full-on Mortlach brawny muscle, with chestnut honey-glazed venison. Water bringing out sweetness, but without ever losing that glowering core. Lovers of the old 16 year old apply here.",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glenrothes) 17 year old, 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,117,101 to 500 Dollars,"Light amber. The initial impression is one of bulk. There are heavy florals — think lilies and stewed white fruit, and just-overripe banana — but this is given a mysterious extra heft by an underpinning of a light meatiness, accompanied by a tiny lift of (good) sulfur. The palate is, unsurprisingly, thick and creamy with huge fruit that fills the mouth. A highly physical, old-style Speyside dram with classic distillery character. A statement whisky that is a must-try.",
"Tamdhu Batch Strength, 58.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,88,0 to 100 Dollars,"More smoke than is common from this distillery and age. The aromas are food-related: initially roast ham with caramelized sugars, then a clambake, then oven-roasted lobster. With water, a distinct whiff of the goat shed (nice, by the way). The palate is refined and mature, but with fresh fruits retained, with oak and smoke beautifully integrated. A mature Caol Ila in similar vein to the excellent (and significantly more keenly priced) 25 year old. (7,638 bottles)",
"Glen Garioch Cask No. 986 13 year old, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,89,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Cutty Sark lost its way in recent years; expect that to change soon. Its owners have plans to return it to glory (and to include a 30 year old among its expressions — you read it here first). For the time being — if you can find it — this 18 year old is a sublime mix of soft plum and peach, sweet, pure grain, easy-drinking vanilla, and a deft oakiness all delivered in gentle and harmonious fashion. Masterful blending.",
"The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Glen Garioch) 20 year old 1994 (cask #15), 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Much of Caol Ila’s malt goes into Johnnie Walker blends, so it’s a rare treat to see a cask strength offering. This release is Caol Ila on steroids, featuring a deeply smoky and meaty nose with bacon, campfire, leather, sea salt, and iodine. On the palate, the smoky fire continues to burn with intense smoke and salt combined with sweet honey malt.  An extremely long finish will have you exhaling smoke long after the dram is gone. (Julio’s Liquors only)",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Miltonduff) 22 year old, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,127,101 to 500 Dollars,"The smoking wicks of church candles, smoked meat, coastal notes, cumin, coriander seed, and herbal elements. A sophisticated palate of unsweetened fruit. Peaches, citrus, and pineapple, with a waxy presence building later on, settles to a dry finish of herbs and beeswax. We can easily overlook the narcissism of making tributes to your own past bottlings as John Glaser turns whisky resurrectionist in homage to Eleuthera. Layered, complex, thought provoking, and finely tuned for the connoisseur.",
"Glenfarclas 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,99,0 to 100 Dollars,"Holy Moly! Where do they find them? Over 40 years old and this seizes your attention with a becoming nose of smoked ham, sweet paprika, and red currant jelly. It’s extremely fruity with just the right level of tartness to keep it in balance; pomegranate, strawberry laces, crystalized fruits, and a nip of licorice adding to the richness and emerging creaminess before a dry finish of Victoria plums. Simply a gorgeous old grain. (300 bottles for UK, Europe, Scandinavia, and Japan) £155",
"Compass Box The Peat Monster, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Deep amber. Big, resinous, and almost heathery, with significant cask influence for a decade-old dram. The aroma is like a cobbler’s workshop: oils, leather, grease, polish, and then licorice. On the palate, there’s the prune notes of armagnac, the sweetness and cedar flavors of old rum, and very Rothes-esque spiciness. Water, just a drop, lightens it a little, allowing the underlying sweetness to show. Not cask dominated, just bottled at exactly the right moment. Recommended. £68",
"William Grant Rare Cask Reserves Blended Reserve 26 year old, 42%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,399,101 to 500 Dollars,"Imagine sipping this sophisticated libation at the supper club turned out in your best bib and tucker. There’s a purity to it, with aromas of fresh red apples, raisins in honey, ground cinnamon, and nutmeg, leading to bitter orange oils and a storm of black pepper fading to tropical fruit, layered caramel, and sugared almonds. Hold this long in the mouth, as it possesses a changing, multi-faceted character. As Cab Calloway said, “This is Hep.” (3,456 bottles) £650",
"Scallywag Cask Strength, 53.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,76,0 to 100 Dollars,"This Kickstarter-funded blend is a very savvy and seamless mix of 40% malt and 60% grain whiskies. Pale gold in color, the nose is inviting, with dried apricot, honey, tangerine, and salt. Everything from the nose comes together on the palate, which is soft and sweet with the right amount of oak and smoke to balance everything out. There's a dash of heat and a solid finish. Who'd ever expect such a smart and affable whisky to come from Kickstarter? (U.S. only)",
"The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 1968 46 year old (Cask# 7293), 45.9%",Single Malt Scotch,90,27620,10001 and above,"Brace yourself. This takes peat to the extreme, conjuring up a moist, chocolate slab of peat being cut and lifted out of the bog. So smoky, you will feel like you’re breathing in the dense clouds rising above the smoldering kilns. A punchy thwack of peat at full strength, and even if you cut it with water, it only highlights salty fishboxes and some buttery caramels cowering from the backdraft. A deliberately singular character, but utterly brilliant nonetheless. £46",
"Laphroaig 32 year old, 46.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,1500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Light gold. A beautiful oxidized note, with soft fruitcake, steamed pudding, a little hint of overripe fruits, and sweet spices. As it opens, there’s barley sugar sweets, then custard tart with nutmeg, clover honey, and marzipan. Complex, in other words. Water shows how well-layered it is. It starts sweetly in the mouth with a thick, honeyed texture, which becomes more delicate with water. Elegant, long, and a great example of mature ’Rothes. £80",
"Ballantine’s Limited, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,229,101 to 500 Dollars,"Ian MacLeod’s first release of Tamdhu was a belter. Now, finally, it’s been joined by this high-strength NAS. There’s no hint of the high strength on the nose, which is all caramel toffee and shortbread, backed with sultana-like sherry cask influence. The palate is the same: nut, dark fruits, and date. Hugely approachable. With water, it’s a matter of…chocolate? Maltesers! All you want in a sherried whisky, and it won’t burn a hole in your wallet either. £60",
"Glenfarclas 50 year old, 41.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,2339,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"“Ardbeg in Perpetuum” would mean “Ardbeg forever.” It’s made up of a mélange of different casks: American oak, refill, French oak…and others. Intense, marine, with pineapple, wet moss, tar, cracked black pepper, and a nuttiness. The palate is oily, sweet, with smoked cream, balanced by a very pure acidity, then soot and char. Will the fact that it isn’t an extreme Ardbeg satisfy everyone? Probably not. Is it a bloody good session drink? Damn right it is. (200th anniversary bottling)",
"Lagavulin 18 year old Fèis Ìle (2016 Release), 49.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,162,101 to 500 Dollars,"An old-style whisky that harkens back to a time when Scotland wasn’t sliced and diced by region, but defined by style. This is meaty with a capital M, with a rich, oily, deep character. On the palate it’s big and beautiful, with salt, oyster shell, honey, roasted green pepper, smoke, dried fruit, beef jerky, leather, and oak. Earthy peat smoke dances throughout, giving support but never stealing focus. This is about as masculine as Highland whisky gets. (U.S. only)",
"House of Hazelwood 25 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"Immediate rancio notes, with some hazelnut and cheese rind. Added oxidative notes of nuts moves things into Brandy de Jerez territory. Sumptuous stuff, with Miltonduff’s floral character adding a delicate top note, something which is enhanced with water. The tannins are light, allowing a silky feel to predominate, with just enough of a bitter edge to add interest. Very good indeed. £81",
"Longmorn 16 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,90,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"Weighty and deep. Instantly seductive: vanilla pod, rich fruits, the smell of fur coats. A femme fatale of a malt. A base of crisp malt mixes with oak to give balance and structure. Water brings out apple leaf, even a little grassiness. The palate is broad and balanced, with real sweetness and a tongue-coating quality which softens to dried fruit, earthy density, with a whiff of smoke. Redolent with the aroma of a dunnage warehouse. A class act.",
"The Macallan 12 year old Double Cask, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,90,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"A fantastically earthy whisky bristling with real, grubby peat: more blazing, bothy peat fire than coastal campfire. Fleeting elements of fudge and smoldering, mellow cigar stubs. A smooth, creamy blend with lemon curd, vanilla sponge, mint, smoked prosciutto, and a dollop of malt. There’s wonderfully smoky, singeing heat at the back of the palate, though it feels like the Islay peat has been pegged back for the 2015 batch. A succulent and smoky finish to warm the soul.",
"The Macallan Edition No. 2, 48.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,105,101 to 500 Dollars,"William Grant & Sons will be releasing a series of Ghosted Reserves in the years ahead, drawing on their remaining stock from closed distilleries. Here, Brian Kinsman has used whisky from Ladyburn and Inverleven to create a nose of zesty key lime pie, peach, butter mintoes, and sweet oak. It is truly moreish, with creamy, malty flavors of sweet mandarin, marzipan, and strawberry with a chalky mouthfeel of candy sticks that lingers through the finish. Exceptionally good whisky. (6,000 bottles)",
"Tomintoul 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,415,101 to 500 Dollars,"As if this cheeky devil from Douglas Laing wasn’t good enough already! Strawberry napoleon, mint leaves rubbed between finger and thumb, runny honey, fresh peach, and wood whittled on the back porch. The sweet orange starts gossamer light, then it hits the gas: the citrus becomes more tangy, touching blood orange, fizzy sweeties become taffy candy, then sherbet. Eventually pacified, it becomes milky and sweet, with milk chocolate melting on the tongue. A creamy finish like a mother’s embrace. £50",
"Bruichladdich Octomore 10 Second Limited Edition, 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,235,101 to 500 Dollars,"The oldest of the set shows a shift into a sense of calm and quietude. The dried blossoms of youth are there, still with a little color to them, while a curl of smoke also comes through. Then, out of nowhere, a sudden eruption of tropical fruits, a flaring in the dying light. There’s no oakiness, just a distillery, framed, gently receding. A remarkable dram. It’s almost shameful to discuss cost! £19,000",
"Port Charlotte 10 Second Limited Edition, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,90,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"A (very) special anniversary bottling, this is old-style, brooding Laphroaig. Fully mature and rich, it shows that classic roiling mass of kelp, oil, and brine, always balanced by sweetness: in this case autumn berry fruits. Malt adds a crunchiness. The palate is gentle and slow with the characteristic camphoraceous lift of bog myrtle on the back palate, which is all that remains of the smoke. Pricey, yes, but rare. Get saving!",
"Loch Lomond 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,99,0 to 100 Dollars,"If Willy Wonka was ever inclined to condense a knickerbocker glory into a dram, it would nose and taste like this: caramel toffee, hints of cocoa, peeled banana, chewy marshmallows, cream, and gooey fudge sauce. The palate has banana, slightly burnt caramel, poached pear, and Banoffee pie layered over mixed peel flavors, adding to its delicious appeal. It’s sweet, dry, smooth, and comforting, like that final satisfying mouthful drained from a mug of hot chocolate. Comfort food for thirsty people.",
"Highland Park Fire, 45.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"Just pause for a moment before tasting. 50 years. What has happened in the world during that time? How have you changed? What has it done to the whisky? Added a quiet elegance. It brings to mind elements of long-dried concentrated fruit and nut, damson, even smoke. The tannins are initially dusty, but a splash of water adds a fresh potpourri perfume. Is it expensive? For something that’s spent 50 years in a cask? No, it isn’t. (937 bottles) £1800",
"The Lost Distillery Company Classic Selection Towiemore, 43%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,43,0 to 100 Dollars,"It’s been quite a year for Lagavulin; a 25 year old is due (but no sample at the time of writing). This was a 6,000-strong bottling, aged in refill hoggies and ‘bodega’ butts. Initially restrained and mildly oxidized, it shows angelica, a spritz of lemon juice on potted shrimp, then fennel pollen and water mint. The smoke is pulled back. The palate has orchard fruits, creosote, and moss. Lagavulin’s top notes accentuated, but with the depth of age. £125",
"Tweeddale Last Centennial, 52.2%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,190,101 to 500 Dollars,"Toasty granola, rye crackers, barley sugar sweetness, and Murray Mints make for a balanced nose on this top-of-the-range blend representing the art deco elegance of 1920s Shanghai. A gloriously thick texture of rich citrus blossoms bolstered by toffee, lime, pineapple, tropical fruits, and vanilla sugar. Mr. Kinsman has engineered methodical and well-paced complexity here, with emergent little lights of spiciness. A long-lasting, deep orange buzz and dimming spice round off proceedings. A precious joy indeed. £115 Travel Retail exclusive",

Vanilla, milk chocolate, and honey on the nose, plus quite intense sweet pear and apple notes. More rich fruit notes on the nicely textured palate, with vanilla and milk chocolate carrying over from the nose, plus raisins. The finish is long and silky smooth.",

Fresh and clean at the start, with hints of sweet nut and soft cooked fruits; subtly sherried elements then begin to come through. The palate is balanced, with supple tannins and a dark depth to the mid-palate. Those sweet fruits in the nose continue all the way through. Refined and rather lovely. £85",

The nose is rich and inviting, with apricots in syrup, marzipan, caramel, and new-mown hay. Voluptuous in the mouth, with tangy fruits, barley sugar, cinnamon, sherry, and ultimately coffee grounds. An oaky finish with cocoa powder, white pepper, and lemon juice.",
"Benriach The Original Twelve, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured in a mix of sherry casks and bourbon barrels for over 15 years, the nose is floral and fruity, with honeysuckle, nectarines, malt, and soft spices. Very smooth and creamy on the palate, with apple pie, butterscotch, honey, and tangerines, combining with dried fruits. Citrus fruit and spicy milk chocolate in the medium-length finish.",
"Gordon & MacPhail 125th Anniversary 1979 (Mosstowie, Distilled at Miltonduff; Cask No. 20323), 49.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,2500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"This was aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. The nose yields Jaffa orange, plums, sherry, malt, and vanilla. Ginger, honey, more orange, dried fruit, and toasted oak on the full palate. The finish is relatively long, with spicy orange and oak.

A nutty, peppery palate features orchard fruits, chile spice, and a subtle meatiness. Lemon and oak tannins in the medium-length finish.",
"Big Peat Christmas (2020 Edition), 53.1%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,59,0 to 100 Dollars,"Glen Garioch spirit is sufficiently robust to cope well with virgin oak, and the nose of this expression yields the bold aromas you would expect from heavily-charred virgin oak maturation: spicy milk chocolate, buttery malt, and ripe peaches. Cocoa, malt, and cloves on the palate, plus lots of wood spice. The finish yields vanilla, ginger, and the inevitable oak.",
"Ballantine’s 7 Bourbon Finish, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,38,0 to 100 Dollars,"A whole lotta beach: oyster shells, brine, vanilla saltwater taffy, and bonfire, plus fresh coconut shavings, jasmine, and freesia. Oily in the mouth, it’s drying without water, highlighting salinity, smoke, cigar wrapper, lemon oil, and Jordan almonds. With water, lemon, vanilla taffy, and mouth-puckering saline; the smoke is less overt. It finishes clean, sweet, and simple, with grilled lemon and lingering smoke. (298 bottles; U.S. exclusive)",
"Johnnie Walker Green Label, 43%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"A 2015 addition to the Tomintoul range of single malts carrying age statements, this expression was matured in bourbon casks like the rest of the lineup, but has a slighter higher ABV than most. Toffee, peaches, and newly polished furniture on the nose. Pleasing rounded mouthfeel, with Jaffa orange, honey, malt, black pepper, and developing tannins. The finish yields more malt, lively spices, green apples, black tea, and nutty oak.",
"Dewar's Special Reserve 12 year old, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,32,0 to 100 Dollars,"Hand-rolled tobacco on the early nose, floral, with sweet peat smoke, vanilla, ripe apples, and raspberries heated over a wood fire.

(1,350 bottles for U.S.)",
"BenRiach Authenticus 21 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,170,101 to 500 Dollars,"Warm leather on the nose, slightly prickly spice, damsons dipped in iodine, red berry fruits, barbecued meat, and underlying earthiness. The palate is oily, offering dry, fruity red wine notes, cinnamon, raisins, prune juice, wood embers, and discreet peat smoke. The finish dries, with black coffee, dark berries, and toasted oak.

"Bowmore 1964 Vintage Fino Cask, 49.4%",Single Malt Scotch,89,1500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Initially aged in bourbon casks, this then spent an unspecified period of time in first-fill European oak butts. Rich fruit notes on the nose, marzipan, and light sherry. Sweet floral notes in time, with fondant cream and vanilla pods. Viscous palate delivery, with sweet sherry, cinnamon, baked apple, figs, caramel, and hot chocolate. Orange and allspice on the nutty finish.",
"Bowmore Voyage, 56%",Single Malt Scotch,89,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"The label of this distinctive blend of Highland and Speyside whiskies suggests it is designed for hotter and drier climates, and it works well in a variety of serves. Peach slices, pecan, peanut, cinnamon, nutmeg, grated milk chocolate, baked cookies, and toasted bakery aromas. It’s medium-bodied and eschews sweetness and fruitiness to inhabit a world of dark toffee, Brazil nut, dry oak, malt, plain chocolate, hot peppery spice, and licorice. (3,000 bottles)",
"Bowmore Claret, 56%",Single Malt Scotch,89,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"Dull tropical fruits, followed by emerging vanilla, and more fragrant and perfumed
notes on the nose. Full-bodied, with very sweet citrus fruits on the early palate, which
turn to green berries and dry slowly. Bitter orange, fennel, and oak tannins in the
lengthy finish. Price is for entire Prima & Ultima Collection, of which this whisky is a
part. (469 bottles) £20,000",
"Blackadder 27 years old (distilled at Bowmore), 50.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Sweet antiseptic, brine, new leather, and spice on the nose. The palate is lightly oily,
with lemon juice, grapefruit, salt water, soft peat, and fish smoked on a beach
barbecue. Smoky citrus fruits in the lengthy, gingery finish. Price is for entire Prima
& Ultima Collection, of which this whisky is a part. (499 bottles) £20,000",
Cadenhead,Single Malt Scotch,89,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"Melon, honey, red apples, buttercups, and butterscotch on the nose, with classic
Clynelish wax on the palate. Herbal, with lemon juice that has a little sea salt mixed
into it. Licorice and white pepper in the slightly oily finish. Price is for entire Prima &

and top notes of acacia honey on the nose. Surprisingly nimble on the palate, with
apple, waves of sherry, black cherry jelly, and a gentle buildup of spice, then caramel,
dark sugar, vanilla, and red apple in later phases, though it is still light on its feet. A
smooth clean finish propels more vigorous spice notes across the palate. (Travel

"Mackillop's Choice (distilled at Caol Ila), 15 year old, 1990 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is a new recipe, replacing the old 12 year old. Rounded and warming on the nose, with stewed fruits, orange peel, and a hint of lime. Voluptuous in the mouth, with honey, milky coffee, figs, and dried fruit. Black currants, licorice, and lively spices in the finish. A really satisfying, well-structured dram.",
"Signatory (distilled at Caol Ila) 1989, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"Mosstowie was the name given to single malt produced on Lomond stills at Miltonduff Distillery. Butterscotch, ripening peaches, ripe plums, and a hint of lime on the nose. The palate is viscous, with red berries, peach, and vanilla. Drying steadily in the finish, with aniseed, black pepper, and, finally, black tea. (164 bottles, 16 for U.S.)",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Caol Ila), 14 year old, 1991 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Malted to 208 ppm and matured in a mix of virgin oak and first- and second-fill bourbon and Tennessee whiskey barrels. The nose is fragrant, with pepper, iodine, intense peat smoke, and lemon peel. Juicy orchard fruits and more smoke on the palate, with treacle, caramel, and spice. Black tea, licorice, lingering woody peat, and chile in the finish.",
"	Cadenhead's (distilled at Dalmore) 1987, 59.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,115,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is a spicy prospect, with pepper, lemon bonbons, and dense peat smoke, though the toffee and sweet lemon are well-balanced against the smoke. Sweet lemon meringue pie, candied peel, and a twin assault of smoke and clove-led spices on the palate, though the sweetness mounts a fight back. Great crescendo of flavor as Big Peat tries to show he is the perfect house guest for the holidays. (900 bottles for U.S.)",
"Peerless (distilled at Glen Grant) 1970, 46.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"With a heart of Glenburgie, its bourbon barrel finish delivers a heady hit of vanilla, red apples, and brown sugar sweetness on the nose, with support from baked hazelnut cookies and ground black pepper. Toffee apple, pear, vanilla, salted caramel, and a gentle pepperiness dissipate to reveal caramel, heather honey, pecan pie, cocoa, and dark chocolate. Try this with orange or cocoa bitters in your next Old Fashioned. £28",
"Duncan Taylor 'Rarest of the Rare' Glencraig (distilled at Glenburgie), Cask #2926, 30 year old, 1974 vintage, 42.0%",Single Malt Scotch,89,245,101 to 500 Dollars,"Just as complex as Johnnie Walker Gold, but fuller and more richly textured. (Not surprising, given that there are no grain whiskies in Johnnie Walker Green.) This is one of the finer vatted malts on the market. Its flavors are well-integrated. You’ll find creamy toffee and nougat at its core, which is then layered with notes of vanilla, mint, fresh brine, and even a hint of mustard seed. Excitingly fresh and vibrant on the finish. A whisky for both the blend and single malt drinker. And at $55, it is also fairly valued for an all-malt whisky.",
"Glenfarclas 50 year old 1955 vintage, 44.4%",Single Malt Scotch,89,6000,5001 to 10000 Dollars,"Gold-amber color. Toffee, fruit, and a wisp of smoke underpin floral aromas. On the palate, flavors are nicely balanced and harmoniously interwoven. Gently sweet toffee notes up front gradually yield to drier notes on the finish, with soft, delicate fruit flavors throughout.",
"Glenfiddich 21 year old Gran Reserva Caribbean Rum Finish, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,89,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"The follow-up and older sibling to ""Curiositas."" I’ve been pushing for Speyside distilleries to bump up the peating levels of their malt they use for a long time because a majority of the spirits are big enough to handle the peat smoke, and this whisky proves my point. The tarry, peat smoke and bacon-like notes are a delight, and they are balanced nicely by a honey and apple pie sweetness. Spanish olives in brine, dark chocolate, golden raisin, and subtle spice round out the palate nicely. Not a heavy whisky, but pretty powerful stuff for BenRiach. So nice of the previous owners of this distillery to experiment with higher peating levels decades ago.",
"Glengarioch, 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"Subtle elegance, creamy, and extremely drinkable. Mouthwatering fruity notes (lemon, lime, tangerine, passion fruit) marry well with notes of fresh-cut grass, vanilla, and honey. Very clean too and nicely balanced! When I drink a Lowland whisky this good, I am saddened by all of the Lowland distilleries that have gone silent over the past 25 years, knowing what we have lost. 
",
"Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1983 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Amber-gold color. Exotic tropical fruit aromas (citrus, melon, coconut), with interwoven notes of almonds, pear, honey, and subtle peat smoke. Light to medium in body, and very delicate in nature. On the palate, the whisky begins sweet (especially honey), followed by a basket of exotic fruit and nuts similar to its aroma, becoming drier and distantly smoky on the finish. This Bowmore Fino Cask, a whisky which has aged very well indeed, is the first of three limited edition 1964 vintage Bowmore whiskies to be released over the next year. The two to follow in 2003 have been aged in bourbon oak and oloros sherry casks.",
"Scott's Selection (distilled at Glenlivet) 27 year old 1977 Vintage, 53.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,165,101 to 500 Dollars,"Copper color with shades of ruby. Intriguing aromas of sweet plum, grapes, citrus, peat smoke, seaweed, and brine. Full-bodied and somewhat viscous. Flavors of ripe fruit (plums, grapes, citrus), followed by a burst of more traditional Bowmore flavors (peat smoke, brine, seaweed), finishing with lingering notes of prunes, dates, baker’s chocolate, and licorice.

While there is no age statement, this whisky was aged for 12 years in bourbon barrels, followed by an additional 18 months in ruby port casks. I believe it is the first distillery bottling to marry port with the traditional flavors of an Islay whisky. Because of this, it is best to keep an open mind when trying this whisky, perhaps even having more than one go at it before rendering a verdict. I suspect the more you try Voyage, the more you will like.",
"Glenlivet Archive 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Amber with orange and ruby hues. Aromas of Islay peat smoke, wine fruit, and background floral and spice notes. Flavors reveal more of what the aroma suggests-peat smoke, fruit, and floral/spice notes-with a balancing oak and subtle sea salt and seaweed. The peat smoke particularly comes in on the finish, lest one forgets where Bowmore hails from. There is no age statement on the label, but this whisky has been aged for 12 years in traditional bourbon and sherry barrels, and then finished off for 18 months in Bordeaux (Claret) wine casks. The wine fruit certainly is evident and, like the Glenmorangie Claret Wood Finish offered a year or so ago, will appeal to those with an open mind and willingness to accept new flavors in whisky. Purists will say it detracts from the distillery's character. I believe it's the first smoky whisky that attempts to marry these flavors with claret fruitiness. 480 bottles for U.S. 12,000 bottles for Travel Retail.",
"Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1972 vintage, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,700,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Amber color. Aromas of peat smoke (but more subdued than many Bowmore whiskies in their teens), toasted oak, citrus fruit, vanilla, and a hint of the sea. Its flavors are similar, which express themselves in a very mature manner-oak flavors are more dominant than other components. Still, there is an emerging brine freshness that keeps the whisky from becoming tired and dull. Good, lengthy finish. 
Style: Islay single malt Scotch whisky. Availability: only 244 bottles total.",
"Glenmorangie Tain L'Hermitage Wood Finish 1975 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Antique gold color. Aromas of peat smoke, damp earth, exotic pepper, vanilla, and fruit. Medium body. A great balance of flavors, with a lovely Islay character. The whisky begins sweet up front, ultimately turning pleasingly dry towards the finish. In between you'll enjoy flavors of peat smoke, vanilla, spicy pepper, and delicately honeyed malt, with just a hint of the sea. What I like most about this whisky is its impeccable balance-between youth and maturity, sweetness and dryness-with just the right amount of peat smoke to declare its Islay roots without smothering its other flavors.",
"Gordon & MacPhail Reserve (distilled at Glenrothes), 18 year old, 1986 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"An excellent example of a younger Bruichladdich, and an interesting contrast to the Duncan Taylor expression reviewed above. Appetizing and very clean with a creamy texture. Honey and vanilla notes accentuate a fresh maltiness, with underlying marshmallow, grass and hay. The whisky finishes nicely rounded, pleasingly dry and salty, with a hint of seaweed. A great aperitif.",
"Peerless (distilled at Highland Park) 1967, 40.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,165,101 to 500 Dollars,"Fresh and quite aromatic. Nice interplay between soothing malty sweetness and honest “naked” Caol Ila notes (in the sense that all the classic Caol Ila flavors are exposed-leafy smoke, tarry rope, salt & pepper spice, seaweed, and olive). An evolving whisky, with a phenolic, briny crescendo that lingers. Nicely done. 
",
"Murray McDavid Mission IV (distilled at Highland Park) 1979 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,210,101 to 500 Dollars,"Pale gold color. Aromas and flavors of peat smoke, seaweed, lemon grass, olives, and green peppercorns. Medium bodied, and slightly oily in texture. Long, dry peat smoke finish. Caol Ila is an Islay dram that Laphroaig, Lagavulin, and Bowmore fans must become acquainted with. Although distllery bottlings are not available here in the U.S., many independent bottlers offer it. This expression is young, vibrant, and exciting.",
Murray McDavid ,Single Malt Scotch,89,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"Finished in cognac wood. The cognac wood influence might dominate other whiskies, but the Coal Ila is big enough for challenge. If anything, it seems to contribute a silky elegance to what would otherwise be a brooding, bare-knuckled whisky;. It works nicely. Notes of germinating barley, vanilla cream, grape preserve, and peat bonfire, with a salty, smoky finish. (Available in the Chicago area.) 
",
"Murray McDavid 'Leapfrog' 12 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 1987, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,63,0 to 100 Dollars,"Gold color. Aromas of citrus fruit (lemons, tangerines) and a pot pourri of spices-very fragrant. Appetizing flavors of citrus fruit, exotic spices, along with a slightly briny, peppery finish.",
"Longmorn 16 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,89,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"Mahogany color. Full-bodied, thick and chewy. Incredibly rich aroma and flavors of toffee, fudge, spice cake, ripe fruit, burnished leather, and oak. Nicely balanced throughout, with a long, satisfying finish. 
",
"Scott Selection 1973 (distilled at Macallan), 50.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,230,101 to 500 Dollars,"Soothing vanilla cream, with additional notes of spice cake, coconut marshmallow, tiramisu, fresh cut grass, and a hint of evergreen. A true ""comfort"" whisky. Just don’t add any water, because it will fall flat. This whisky is great just the way it is. 
",
"The Macallan 21 year old Fine Oak, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,220,101 to 500 Dollars,"The oldest whisky ever bottled by Glenfarclas. Fortunately, Glenfarclas ages very nicely. This whisky proves my point. It is very complex, with notes of burnished leather, roasted nuts, fruit cake, toffee apples, sultana, damp peat, and sappy oak. A very soothing whisky, with the depth and maturity one hopes for in a whisky this old. Only 110 bottles produced and only 18 destined for the U.S.",
"Bowmore 10 year old Tempest (Release 2), 56%",Single Malt Scotch,88,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"The whisky is quite fruity (green grape, orange, tangerine, and dark cherry), with balancing notes of vanilla, roasted nuts, and a hint of peat. Dry, lightly spicy finish that lingers. It is complex and nicely balanced for a whisky of this age. Still, I feel the 15 year old Fine Oak edition is better and, at $65, one-tenth the cost.",
"Provenance (distilled at Port Ellen), 21 year old, 1982 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,195,101 to 500 Dollars,"Amber gold color. Surprisingly smoky aroma balanced nicely with mature oak notes, roasted nuts, tobacco, and malty sweetness in the background. Firm body. Delicious flavors of toasted oak, roasted nuts, smoke, leather, and malt. The flavors are interwoven nicely with great balance. Satisfying finish. 
",
"Scapa 25 year old, 54%",Single Malt Scotch,89,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Amber Aroma: Rich and rather full for Glenlivet, with nuts and fruit, drenched with layers of toffee and caramel. Palate: Rich and enveloping-almost chewy-with notes of toffee and caramel up front. Delicate fruit, nuts and spice emerge mid-palate, adding complexity, becoming dry with a long spicy finish",
"Signatory (distilled at Springbank) 1969 Vintage 34 year old, 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,89,485,101 to 500 Dollars,"Very stylish. Quite refined too, with notes of vanilla, peaches and flowering currant. The whisky is very soft on the palate, delicate and almost bashful at times. Indeed, it may take a couple of dates with this whisky for it to fully to reveal itself. The whisky finishes toasty, with a pleasing cereal grain maltiness. Some whiskies are great after dinner; others make wonderful pre-dinner drams. This one is great anytime.",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Strathisla) 40 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,89,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"New packaging and new whisky too-sort of. According to Glenlivet’s whisky maker Jim Cryle, Archive is now being bottled in smaller batches, allowing them to be more selective in the casks used to improve its quality and flavor. I believe that it has worked. It tastes more refined. Along with Archive’s signature creamy toffee notes, I’m picking up beautiful floral, vanilla, and fruity notes (peaches, pineapple, coconut) on the nose and palate, with subtler nutty, anise threads throughout. An elegant expression of Glenlivet.",
"Talisker 25 year old, 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,225,101 to 500 Dollars,"Lovely bouquet of dried citrus fruit, honeyed apricot and plum, complemented by exotic wood spice, malty vanilla, and a hint of mint and anise. Similar follow-through on the palate, with the sweeter notes up front, full fruit impact mid-palate, leading to a dry, peppery, exotic wood spice finish. The whisky evolves on the palate and is very impressive, with its only blemish being a bit too dry and oaky on the finish.",
"Talisker 30 year old, 50.7%",Single Malt Scotch,89,350,101 to 500 Dollars,"For those of you drinking whisky long enough, it was a Glenmorangie Tain L’Hermitage 1978 Vintage that kick-started this whole exotic finish trend by Glenmorangie about 10 years ago. That one wasn’t sold here in the U.S., but this one is (although this one costs about four times as much as the original one did when it was released). Both were racked in used bourbon barrels before being finished in Hermitage red wine casks from northern Rhone. The best of these limited release Glenmorangies, like the Fino Sherry Finish expression several years ago, add complexity and intrigue without masking Glenmorangie’s lovely subtle complexity. This one does a pretty good job of it, although there’s a lot of fruit here (an obvious contribution of the wine). Complex fruit, with notes of plum, raspberry, nectarine, blueberries, and a hint of lemon. Underneath the fruit, there’s nougat, dark chocolate and cocoa. Towards the finish, the whisky becomes nicely dry with oak lingering on the palate.",
"Lagavulin 21 year old, 56.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"It's nice to see Gordon & MacPhail bottlings at strengths higher than 40%, and it makes this already hefty whisky even more so. It is fragrant (with subtle heather notes), rich and malty (and quite thick in texture), with notes of honey and vanilla. Interwoven fruit (sultana, along with subtle lemon and orange) add complexity. All this sweetness is rounded out nicely with a long, dry, oaky/spicy finish. A delicious, evolving whisky. (Bottled exclusively for Binny's Beverage Depot.)",
"Springbank 14 year old Fino Cask (#265), 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Very powerful and quite different from the 10 year old, 46% bottling reviewed below; this tastes as if it is taken entirely from bourbon oak-aged Springbank. There’s fresh brine, creamy vanilla, honey, and coconut throughout, and it lacks the waxed fruit nature of its sibling. Mouthcoating in texture, with a long appetizing briny finish. Very clean -- and quite polished too, for such a powerful whisky. My choice of the three.",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Bunnahabhain) cask #7020 39 year old, 40.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,420,101 to 500 Dollars,"Clean and fragrant on the nose, with aromas of dried heather, germinating barley, and white chocolate. Soft, sweet malt along with honeycomb, crème brulee, and a hint of fruit puree. The palate is soothingly malty, delivering what the aroma promised (first the sweet notes, then dried heather and spice), with a dry, polished oak finish. The extra aging adds depth, and the cask was obviously a good one, with no hint of being tired or old.",
"The Glenrothes, 1985 Vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Yellow gold color. Fresh, floral aromas (reminiscent of a spring garden), creamy vanilla, honey, heather, subtle fruit, and a hint of toasted oak. Elegant and nicely balanced. Medium in body, but richly so. Richly flavored, too, and nicely balanced, with notes that echo the aromas. In fact, this is one of the most balanced whiskies I've had in quite a while. A hint of salt, spice, and seaweed on the finish linger on indefinitely. This whisky is a pure joy to drink and demonstrates why Highland Park is so highly regarded. The fact that it was aged in a bourbon cask allows this whisky's more subtle notes to be fully appreciated. Quite delicious!",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Mosstowie), cask #5814, 30 year old, 48.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,275,101 to 500 Dollars,"White wine color. Seaweed, briny aromas and flavors. The classic Laphroaig medicinal, pungent, smoky rush kicks in on the finish and stays in overdrive for a very long time.",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glenlivet), cask #2831, 39 year old, 44.7%",Single Malt Scotch,89,305,101 to 500 Dollars,"Longmorn is now being bottled one year older. Whisky companies seem to be discontinuing odd-year whiskies. Bowmore recently extended their 17 year old to 18. Ironically, in both instances, the older whiskies serve up more sherry and fruit. Both the Longmorn 15 and Bowmore 17 were considered benchmark whiskies, so these changes weren’t without risk. Still, in both instances, the new expressions won’t disappoint. This new Longmorn shows a mouth-coating maltiness -- Longmorn’s signature characteristic. Along with this, there’s ripe barley, honeyed fruit (peach, with subtle sultana and pineapple), gently complex nuts (almonds, brazil nuts), and a hint of chocolate-covered coconut. A lush, fruity-sweet dram that lingers long on the palate. True Longmorn devotees will still want to purchase a bottle of the 15 year old while they can.",
"Ardbeg Supernova, 58.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Deep gold color. Fragrant, floral aroma, with a potpourri of dried spices, especially vanilla and nutmeg. Creamy texture. Flavors of creamy vanilla and caramel, becoming dry with subtle spices and just a hint of fruit.",
"Port Ellen, 29 year old, 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,400,101 to 500 Dollars,"Even drier and expressing more of the complex floral and spice notes found in the 15 year old. However, by the time the whisky reaches mid-palate, the dried fruits, dried spices, and general wood notes become prominent, preventing the whisky from revealing other sides of its usually multi-faceted personality. It’s still a very fine whisky, but not as good as the 15, regardless of price.",
"Port Charlotte PC7, 61%",Single Malt Scotch,89,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"Toffee and nougat, with a lacing of cotton candy. It then turns richly nutty-almost chewy-with notes of dried apricot, sultana, and a touch of red currant. Firm, dry, oak resin finish. A well-structured whisky, indicative of the Mortlach pedigree. 
",
"Tomintoul 33 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,290,101 to 500 Dollars,"One of the last remaining vintages from an Islay distillery which will be missed dearly. This is obviously from a sherry cask, and the peat smoke, sherry, and oak-aging is married nicely here. It a brooding Port Ellen. Notes of peat fires, fig, kippers, toffee, vanilla, and dry oak take turns entertaining the palate. Considering its age, it isn’t excessively oaked, and the Port Ellen character still shines through. If you’re going to track down a bottle of Port Ellen before they get really difficult to find, this one is worth serious consideration. 
",
"Ardbeg Rollercoaster, 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"A limited edition of 2000 bottles. Thick and syrupy on the palate, accentuated with vanilla and shortbread. You’ll also find pleasing peaches & cream, zingy citrus fruit, along with a hint of nuts, spice, and a pinch of salt on the palate. A nice addition to the 14 year old distillery bottling. Kudos for bottling it at cask strength. 
",
"Black Bull, 12 year old, 50%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Older Springbanks are becoming hard to find, and this one won't disappoint. It is packed with citrus notes (lemon, orange) often found in whiskies over 30 years old. Along with them you'll find subtle spice notes (especially cinnamon), red licorice, polished oak, and that signature Springbank fresh brininess, albeit a bit reserved. This Springbank is not as heavily sherried as some other older bottlings that have come and gone. If I wanted to be picky, I would like to see more of the Springbank briny zest and freshness here, but, giving its age, it is understandably reserved. This whisky's best feature is how surprisingly clean, rounded, and polished it is for 33 years old. Very nice.",
"The Balvenie Caribbean Rum Cask 14 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Deep amber color. Mature aroma-this is definitely an old whisky -with complex wood spices (cedar, vanilla, mint, caramel) and soft ripe fruit. Medium bodied and soft. Surprisingly balanced on the palate with an incredible depth and maturity. Its flavors are similar to its aroma, but a soft sweetness compliments the flavors and provides balance. Soothing, mellowing finish of considerable depth. 
",
"Signatory 20 year old (distilled at Aberlour) 1990 vintage (Cask #101777), 56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"More subtle and teasing. Not as much a knock-out punch on the finish like the Talisker 10 and 18, but rather more steady intense blows to the abdomen for many rounds. An aging Talisker, but still with many redeeming qualities. It is drier than its younger siblings, with less fruit and more of a stony texture, with dried spices and lingering leather notes. This whisky requires more patience and demands more concentration, but it is still rewarding to the seasoned aficionado (with some extra pocket change). 
",
"Auchroisk 20 year old, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,175,101 to 500 Dollars,"A graceful Talisker. Soft toffee and caramel with balanced, gentle fruit. Hints of boat dock wood, damp peat, and fish nets. Warming spice notes (anise, pepper, and salt) provide intrigue and linger on through a warming, spicy finish. Well rounded, with enough depth on the palate to make up for the lack of punch in younger expressions.",
"Glenkinchie 20 year old, 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,189,101 to 500 Dollars,"A thick, sweet, weighty Lagavulin -- the kind you eat with a fork. Interwoven caramel and molasses laced with thumping waxed fruit, dates, burnt walnuts, and peat kiln embers that linger long on the palate. A mouthful!",
"Douglas of Drumlanrig (distilled at Caol Ila), Cask #6616, 1985 vintage, 25 year old, 53.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"Finished in sauternes wood. I really love how the appetizing notes of Pulteney marry with the sweet notes of the sauternes wine cask. Light-medium in body, but good viscosity. Fresh brine throughout, with honey-drenched melon fruit, pineapple in syrup, citrus, and a hint of cotton candy and lightly toasted marshmallow. A delicious marriage of two high-caliber drinks categories.",
"BenRiach Solstice 15 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,89,87,0 to 100 Dollars,"There have been several lovely older expressions of Bunnahabhain over the past decade, and this is one of them. The vanilla cream and toffee nuttiness is balanced perfectly by polished oak, bright fruit (apricot, sultana, cherry pits), and subtle anise. There’s a calming quality to this whisky that is very more-ish. All the maturity of an older whisky without the tired, dominating oak.",
"Glenlivet 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Glenglassaugh initially imported Massandra wine casks from the Crimea in 2010 for finishing purposes, and that was the first time the winery had allowed its wood to be exported. In 2014, two Massandra cask finishes were released. Distilled in 1978, the Madeira-finished nose yields dates, sultanas, stewed fruit, caramel, a hint of smoke, and spices. Smooth on the palate, with apricots, cocoa powder, oak, and lots of spice development. The softly-oaked finish is lengthy, citric, and spicy. £395",
"Longmorn 16 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,89,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"Part of the “Rarest of the Rare” collection. Mosstowie was a limited production using Lomond stills for a brief time at the Miltonduff distillery. Very pale in color for a 30 year old whisky, and creamy on the palate. A very clean whisky. Bright fruit (apricot, lemon, sultana) and vanilla are the main flavors, with more subtle grass and hay notes. Soothing finish.",
"Kilchoman Spring 2011 release, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"This whisky fits the profile of other extra-matured Glenlivet whiskies I’ve tasted. Notes of coconut and other assorted tropical fruit, old rum, caramel custard, shortbread cookies, vanilla malt, and a hint of cotton candy. This is all balanced by polished oak. A soothing, rather sweet whisky (which is quite surprising for its age).",
"Springbank 11 year old, 58%",Single Malt Scotch,89,105,101 to 500 Dollars,"Identifiably richer, fuller, and smokier on the nose when compared to other young Ardbegs. While still prominent, there’s slightly less brine and seaweed, more earthiness, tar, soot, espresso, tobacco, grass, and chocolate fudge. The same goes for the palate. It starts out like a “slightly more gutsy than normal” cask strength, young Ardbeg (e.g., Renaissance) and, if you go into this experience expecting to be totally blown away by peat, tar, and smoke, you might feel a bit under-challenged initially. But the peat eventually builds to a powerful, lava-like crescendo and you realize that this is no ordinary Ardbeg. The length of the finish is seemingly endless; bold and warming. Through all this, there’s a soft underbelly of ripe barley and a vanilla sweetness to balance at least some of the tar, heat, and smoke -- something I admire in many Ardbegs. Bottom line: It’s an interesting, entertaining, and eye-opening experience. I like how mature it tastes for a relatively young whisky. But, like a whisky that shows just a bit too much sherry or oak, I think the extra peat, to a degree, masks the subtle complexities I admire in some other, lesser-peated Ardbegs, which is the only thing keeping me from scoring this whisky in the 90s. All smoky whisky enthusiasts should endeavor to try this at least once.",
"Cutty Sark 18 year old, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"An elder Port Ellen, but still showing plenty of Port Ellen character. It’s chock full of kiln smoke, damp forest, seaweed, charcoal, brine, and tar. Additional notes of licorice root, kalamata olive, cinnamon, and black pepper, with teasing citrus emerging occasionally. Warming, tarry, dry smoke finish. An old-fashioned, pungent Islay whisky.
",
"Berry Brothers & Rudd (distilled at Mortlach) 1989 21 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,89,94,0 to 100 Dollars,"Aged in a combination of sherry and bourbon oak. Bold and fresh, bursting with testosterone. Notes of damp kiln smoke, tar, wet sheep, roasted chestnuts, and pine forest bedding, along with more subtle pear, espresso, anise, and brine. Sweet notes of vanilla, fig cake, and maple syrup serve up balance and complexity. Appetizing brine and tar finish. It’s more mature than last year’s PC6. Earthier and less fruity, too! Plus, I feel that the sherry notes in PC7 integrate better than the Madeira notes from PC6. But my favorite is still the original PC5 for its purity, balance, maturity (for its age), and pristine character. (I lined up all three yesterday and tasted them side-by-side.)",
"Balblair 2000, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"Younger Tomintoul whiskies are fairly straightforward, unassuming whiskies. Older expressions show more depth. What they all seem to have is a remarkable balance. Moreover, this whisky and its predecessor, the 27 year old, are surprisingly delicate and nimble for their age. This is an elegant whisky, with a toffee foundation, creamy vanilla, nougat, light summer fruits, a kiss of molasses, and gentle spice (cinnamon, mocha). Soft finish. Very pleasing.
",
"Scotch Malt Whisky Society (28:23) 21 year old, 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"Deep gold color. Very bold aroma of toffee, dark chocolate, diesel fuel-soaked soil, smoldering campfire, coal tar, clove, leather, fig, and dark berried fruit. More of the same on the palate, with seaweed, smoked haddock, and cough drops emerging towards the finish. This whisky is very dynamic and exciting to drink. My only criticism: it comes across a little green on the finish, which keeps me from scoring it in the 90s. Still, it’s pretty impressive considering how young some of the whiskies in it are. If you like your Islay whiskies young and brooding, this one’s for you.",
"The Whisky Exchange Elements of Islay Pe5 (distilled at Port Ellen), 57.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,279,101 to 500 Dollars,"Quite rich and chewy, with nutty toffee, vanilla fudge, nougat, chocolate cake, orchard fruit, and black cherry—all on a solid malty foundation. This isn’t one of those elegant, lighter-flavored blends with a high grain whisky content. The focus here is on fullness of flavor. A blend for the malt whisky drinker (but should also appeal to the more open-minded blend drinker, too).",
"Highland Park 1976 Vintage, 49.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,2880,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"A new addition to the permanent Balvenie range. Lovely bright gold color. Layers of sweetness (the characteristic Balvenie honey, along with vanilla fudge, nougat, and rich toffee) peppered with dried spice and a hint of tropical fruit (papaya, guava, tangerine). Nice viscosity with good grip on the finish. I really like the balance and complexity of this whisky. A very solid effort and the price is right.",
"Rosebank 21 year old 1990 (Diageo Special Releases 2011), 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,261,101 to 500 Dollars,"Matured in a bourbon hogshead. Floral nose. Soft, creamy, and elegant, with honeyed malt, custard, subtle butterscotch, and delicate fruit (orange, peach) peppered with spice (powdered vanilla, nutmeg). Well-balanced, gently dry, and easy drinking. A charming whisky (for a lazy Sunday afternoon, perhaps?)",
"Glenfarclas Family Cask 1982 (Cask #4567), 56%",Single Malt Scotch,89,329,101 to 500 Dollars,"Poor old Auchroisk. Not only couldn’t anyone pronounce it correctly (it’s “Oth Rusk,” in case you’re interested), but in recent years it’s seen its Singleton prefix hijacked by other larger distilleries — Glendullan, Dufftown, Glen Ord — leaving it somewhat forgotten by malt mavens. Part of the old J&B stable, it continues to make a malty/nutty spirit, a style which is also somewhat out of favor in the world of single malts. 
Maybe this bottling (in a rather spiffing retro pack) will redress the balance. The color is full gold, and though initially the nose shows the high bottling strength to the max, beneath the prickly heat is eucalyptus oil alongside those signature nutty/cereal notes. But here’s the difference; there’s sweetness, too: toffee and thick clover honey, even a touch of sawdust and pencil shavings before a drop of water brings out malted milk and powdered hazelnut. In other words, there’s plenty of distillery character, but good cask development. 
In the mouth, when neat, the needling alcohol slightly numbs the tongue and the effect from start to finish is a bit fragmented. Add water, however (not too much), and there’s a soft, creamy effect across the tongue with praline, almond, and a dark chocolate note as well. Be careful with the water though, as you need to retain the zesty acidity on the finish. ",
"Glenfiddich Cask of Dreams, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,99,0 to 100 Dollars,"If Cragganmore is sometimes overlooked, then what of this poor Lowlander whose qualities are consistently overlooked? Again, here we have a pale color suggesting use of refill casks, but whereas Cragganmore was reticent to the point of being mute, this is expressive and lively. The nose, with intense floral notes of lilac blossom, freesia, and chamomile, is a revelation. These are backed with a thick, unsalted butter note that suggests that the cask might not have been as quiet as first imagined. Give it time, and out come boiled sweets and a fresh green note, like a just-whittled stick. A hint of wheat chaff and fragrant grasses brings to mind lying in a summer meadow watching the dust motes dance in the sunshine. The mouth is sweet and lemon-accented with a pickup of a pleasant chalkiness on the nose that gives it the suggestion of a fino sherry or Vin Jaune. I like its energy, and feel that the addition of water reduces its vibrancy, so for drinking purposes I’d have a glass of ice cold water on the side. All in all impressive, with just a hint of soap on the finish taking it below the 90 mark.",
"Caol Ila 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Soft and gentle (for Caol Ila, that is), thanks to the 25 years of aging. Plenty of creamy vanilla and honey to go with the malty foundation, along with coal tar, licorice root, and olive, with a hint of brine, juniper, unsweetened dark chocolate, and tobacco (cigars in a humidor?). Very nice. (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)",
"Cragganmore Distillers Edition 1997, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,67,0 to 100 Dollars,"A heavily peated BenRiach that has been finished in a tawny port pipe. The nose is akin to cherries, sloes, and blueberries soaked in alcohol. The peatiness manifests itself as a smoky herbal note and shows most on the palate, but is never too dominant. An oil of clove coolness takes control on the finish. Great balance and integration; a finish that genuinely works. £53",
"Old Pulteney WK209 ‘Good Hope,’ 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,63,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distilled at Glen Garioch when peated barley was still being used, this 1991 vintage is quite reticent on the nose, considering its strength. Subtle malt and fudge notes, plus a hint of wood smoke. Fresh fruits and a sherbet ‘zing’ on the palate, with a suggestion of treacle. Developing spicy smokiness. Fruitiness is emphasized when water is added. The ‘zing’ — now ginger — lasts to the end of the medium-length finish, with advancing, discreet oak. (Only 120 bottles for the U.S.) ",
"Wemyss Malts ‘Winter Spice’ Single Cask, 44.4%",Single Malt Scotch,89,172,101 to 500 Dollars,"Longmorn may be slightly better known, but it’s still pretty much a cult whisky — with a huge following in Japan, where every whisky bar seems to have multiple expressions. This bottling shows it in its lushest guise, with masses of caramelized soft fruits, banana, cream toffee, and chocolate. The palate shifts between raisin and plum. Elegant. ",
"A.D. Rattray (distilled at Highland Park) 19 year old 1992, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"A marriage of 3 and 4 year old whisky aged in first-fill bourbon barrels, with the 4 year old portion being finished in oloroso sherry casks. Among the best of the Kilchoman releases to date. The first-fill bourbon packs a flavor punch, while the sherry softens, rounds, and adds complexity. Barrel char, burnt raisin, boat dock, and tarry rope, softened by caramel and enhanced with notes of tropical fruit. Surprisingly mature for its age and very distinctive. ",
"Ardbeg Day, 56.7%",Single Malt Scotch,89,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"Finished in a rum cask. Gently sweet (caramel, vanilla cream, kiss of honey), with balancing fruit (lime, kiwi, green grape) and spice (white pepper, brine). Youthful (but not immature). Invigorating briny finish. I don’t know what kind of rum cask was used, but it comes across more like sugar cane juice-based rhum agricole than the molasses-based rums. Very nice! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.) ",
"BenRiach Pedro Ximenez Sherry Wood Finish 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Need you ask? An unmistakable classic and an exemplar of a blended Scotch whisky, famous around the world. Toffee, swirling caramel, whole almond, and mashed banana amid twisting white smoke. The palate has such poise, balance, and dexterity that it sets the standard for many less accomplished blends to aspire to. Conspicuously iconic, and the closest thing you will find to a complete whisky at this price.",
"Glenury Royal 40 year old, 59.4%",Single Malt Scotch,89,824,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Immediately identifiable as Mortlach, with a pleasant, feral mélange of meat mingled with milk chocolate and gorse. There is elegant sweetness here, but expressed as a mix of the bittersweet caramelized juices stuck to the bottom of a roasting pan, with honey. The palate, unsurprisingly, is big, and medium dry, but here as well there’s some sweetness in the form of black fruits. Mortlach, but in a slightly subtler guise than usual. £60",
"The Dalmore 1973 38 year old, 48.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,17600,10001 and above,"The 2000 vintage of Balblair is intended to replace the well-regarded 1997 variant. Matured in first-fill American oak, this very drinkable expression represents good value for the money. A pretty peach and pineapple nose, with coconut and honeyed vanilla. Toasted marshmallows with time. Relatively light-bodied, sweet, with lively spice, ginger, and youthful oak on the relatively complex palate. Fudge in the finish, and a contrasting hint of dark chocolate at the last.",
"The Dalmore 1991 20 year old, 57.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,3600,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"This bottling of Tullibardine was distilled in November 1989 and has been matured in a refill sherry butt. The U.S. allocation is 120 bottles. Initially, damp earth on the nose, sweetening to milk chocolate-covered fudge and vanilla, along with hazelnuts. Notes of plum and black pepper with time. The palate is fruity, with toffee, spice, and cedar wood notes. Long in the finish, with cereal and spicy resin. ",
"Cutty Sark Storm, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,31,0 to 100 Dollars,"This, the fifth of TWE’s ongoing Elements bottlings of Islay’s legendary closed distillery, does not disappoint. The nose is akin to salted chocolate, with a wasabi-like earthiness lurking behind. Port Ellen’s characteristic flintiness is there in the form of rock-pools and hot sand inside seashells, while the smoke hints at sphagnum moss, marsh gas, and burnt cake. The palate has touches of smoked eel and a hint of pear. As enigmatic as ever, in other words. £175 (500 ml)",
"Clan Denny Speyside, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is a recent addition to the portfolio, and has been matured in a mixture of thirteen American oak butts and hogsheads. These have given an out-turn of 893 bottles. Freshly-grated ginger, white pepper, and melons on the nose. Soft fruit and spices feature on the palate, with honey and coconut oil, plus background peat smoke. Lively spices, soft oak, and hazelnuts in the finish.",
"Glen Scotia 21 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,145,101 to 500 Dollars,"2011 saw the first expression of Rosebank appear in Diageo’s annual Special Releases series, and just 5,604 bottles are available worldwide. The bottling is comprised of whisky matured in refill American oak and refill European oak casks. Floral and mildly herbal on the nose, with cereal and tropical fruit notes, along with a hint of damp soil. The palate is somewhat tart, with oranges and pepper, while the finish dries to coffee and spicy oak. A lovely example of a much-mourned malt. ",
"Jura Camas an Staca 30 year old, 44%",Single Malt Scotch,89,560,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Amber in color and again some fresh fruitiness, this time mixed with a little cereal. The same dry grass you get on the 1981, but here there’s a nutty, biscuity edge above that meaty solidity. The palate shows slight oiliness and roasted red pepper, that changes into blackberry as it opens. Needs roughly the same amount of water to open fully, which also brings out chamois leather and then barley sugar sweets. Clean but rich — that’s Glenfarclas. (A U.S. exclusive.)",
"Auchentoshan 1979 Oloroso Sherry Matured, 50.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,550,501 to 1000 Dollars,"A vatting of different ages of Glenfiddich (the youngest being 14 years old) aged in American oak, then married in virgin American oak casks on which folk from the States had written their hopes and dreams…Awww! Deliciously fruity and clean, it’s all pear juice, crème brûlée, fudge, cool mint, and dessert apple. With water, there’s dusty cinnamon, kiwi, and milk chocolate. The oak acts as a smoothing base for this fruitiness. A lovely idea and a lovely whisky.",
"Talisker Storm, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,61,0 to 100 Dollars,"Funny to think how recently Caol Ila was an Islay giant that was kept pretty much under wraps by its owner. These days it has cemented its reputation as the island’s Mr. Consistent. This version shows its character the best, a nose that mixes seashore and grass with a distinct hint of smoked bacon. The peatiness isn’t dominant, but flows throughout the palate, scenting, lifting, and subtly changing the mix. A delicious oiliness makes it a great food whisky.",
"Balblair 1969, 41.4%",Single Malt Scotch,89,3500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Cragganmore is a deep malt but its richness is often obscured by its fruity sweetness. A period in port pipes allows this element to be amplified. The black currant is now fully fruited and acts as a flavor bridge while the meatiness that sits underneath and often unseen is revealed. Think cherry pipe tobacco, clove, and dark fruits. Sweet, but not too sweet, and always identifiably Cragganmore. For me, the pick of the bunch.",
"Cutty Sark Cask Strength, 51.4%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,53,0 to 100 Dollars,"WK209 is named after a steam herring drifter registered in the Caithness port of Wick, where Old Pulteney is distilled. This limited edition, travel retail exclusive was matured entirely in first fill European oak sherry casks for 8 to 10 years. Milk chocolate, crème brûlée, old leather, and sherry on the nose, contrasting with brine. Sherry, dried fruits, black pepper, English mustard, and sea salt on the full palate. Spicy sherry, heather, and black coffee in the luxurious finish. €50",
"Tamdhu 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,89,52,0 to 100 Dollars,"This cask strength, 29 year old 1982 expression in the Wemyss Malts range is the company’s first bottling of a single malt distilled at the Northern Highland distillery of Teaninich. Just 201 bottles have been released. The insistently fruity nose features overripe pears, heather in bloom, soft fudge, salted popcorn, cinnamon, and ginger. Soft and peachy on the palate, with darker spice notes, walnuts, and plain chocolate. The finish is lengthy, with more plain chocolate and some spiced oak. £110",
"Springbank Refill Sherry 17 year old, 57%",Single Malt Scotch,89,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Many of the independent H.P. bottlings are aged in bourbon casks, and, like this one, exhibit creamy vanilla, honeyed malt, and citrus. I’m also picking up some more subtle heather, brine, coconut, and nougat. This one is clean on the palate and shows nice balance, with enough dry oak on the finish to counter the whisky’s sweeter notes. (A D&M Wines & Liquors exclusive.)",
"Poit Dhubh 21 year old Blended Malt, 43%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Let it be known that from now on, June 2nd will be Ardbeg Day. That’s fine by me, as annually we can enjoy delights such as this bold expression that belts you in the nose with coal tar and soot before bay rum emerges, lightening slightly into lime and hot green bracken. The palate is oily, sweet, and very deep. A growly bugger that lurches toward the shore and then spins back to the laurel bushes inland. 13,000 bottles.",
"Adelphi 22 year old (distilled at Macallan), 56%",Single Malt Scotch,89,151,101 to 500 Dollars,"A lovely example of what not chill-filtering can do for a whisky. Meticulous cask selection also helps play a part here. Very straightforward on the surface (no surprises), but with vibrant, well-defined flavors and a comforting creamy texture on the palate. Bright fruit defines this whisky (lime, kiwi, ripe melon, sultana, fresh peach), accompanied by honeyed malt, heather, and a hint of spice and smoke. A fun whisky, suitable for many moods and occasions. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.) ",
"Duncan Taylor Dimensions Range (distilled at Longmorn) 1996, 52.6%",Single Malt Scotch,89,154,101 to 500 Dollars,"A belated addition to Diageo’s Special Releases range for 2011, this offering is from the now-demolished distillery in Stonehaven, which closed in 1985. Just 1,500 bottles are available, and maturation has taken place in American oak refill casks filled in 1970. Resin, malt, nutmeg, and wood polish on the nose, with developing vanilla and brittle toffee. Full in the mouth, slightly oily, and notably fruity, with heather and cinnamon notes. Pepper and bitter orange in the long finish. £525",
"Bruichladdich Black Art 4 23 year old, 49.2%",Single Malt Scotch,89,322,101 to 500 Dollars,"Primary maturation took place in an ex-bourbon cask, then from 2006 in a cask sourced from the vineyard of Chateau Haut Marbuzet, previously used to hold Cabernet Sauvignon. A final three years were spent in a newly-emptied bourbon barrel. Gingerbread, summer berries, and fig rolls on the nose. Fudge and vanilla. Black cherries, raisins, lots of lively spice, and a red wine ‘edge’ in the mouth. Freshly-baked ginger cake in the long, spicy finish. Cask number 10; 223 bottles.",
"Arran The Devil’s Punch Bowl Chapter II: Angels & Devils, 53.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"After initial maturation in American white oak, this 1991 expression was filled into a 15 year old Lepanto brandy cask from Gonzales Byass in May 2003, ultimately being re-racked into a fresh ‘distillery run’ bourbon barrel in August 2009. Caramel and white chocolate on the nose, malt, fudge, cinnamon, and nutmeg, then burnt treacle and hot brandy. Malt, sweet spice, almonds, bananas, and fudge on the palate. Spicy fruits in the lengthy Armagnac-like finish. Cask number 1; 233 bottles.",
"Talisker Dark Storm, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,72,0 to 100 Dollars,"Cutty Sark master blender Kirsteen Campbell has hit the ground running and is playing a leading role in the revival of this iconic blend. Storm is a very different whisky than Tam o' Shanter. The nose is nuanced and light, with orange jelly and citrus juice; the palate is sophisticated, fruity, perfectly balanced, rounded, and gentle, with a high-percentage malt content evident in the mix. The finish is quite short but very more-ish. An amazing whisky for the price. £20 VALUE PICK",
"Highland Park Thorfinn, 45.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,1348,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"If big smoke and peat don't float your boat and you'd rather metaphorically skip through a summer orchard while drinking whisky, then the Speyside version of Clan Denny is the full fruit bowl. The mixing of malts means that sherry and bourbon Speysiders get a say, so it's the complete package, and there's lots going on. Ultimately, though, it's not quite as focused as the Islay. Damn close call, though.€36",
"Caol Ila Stitchell Reserve, 59.6%",Single Malt Scotch,89,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"The nose offers tinned peaches, fresh ginger, and a slightly herbal note. The palate is voluptuous, with vanilla, malt, vigorous spices, and white chocolate. Lingering coffee and gingery oak in the finish. ",
"Arran Malt The Millennium Casks, 53.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,108,101 to 500 Dollars,"The latest addition to the Jura range has been matured in American white oak casks before spending three years in Gonzalez Byass oloroso sherry butts. The mellow nose is lightly oily, with figs, sherry, orange, and a savory note. Vanilla emerges, along with malt, and finally a hint of cinnamon and parma violets. Soft and supple on the palate, with more orange, plus cocoa, sultanas, and dates. The finish is lengthy and features dark chocolate, raisins, aniseed, and subtle spices. ",
"Oban 21 year old, 58.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,625,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The latest release in Auchentoshan’s 1970s Vintage Series is this expression, distilled on October 22, 1979 and matured in first-fill oloroso sherry butts for 32 years. Just 1,000 bottles are available (12 bottles for the U.S.). Sweet on the nose, with furniture polish, digestive biscuits, cinnamon, and a faint whiff of old leather. Big tropical fruit notes open the palate, soon turning to smoky blackcurrants, tea, and rich fruit loaf. The finish is spicy, featuring black pepper, tobacco, dark berries, and plain chocolate.",
"Glen Garioch Vintage 1999, 56.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,98,0 to 100 Dollars,"Diageo has introduced this new no age statement variant of Talisker single malt. The name reflects the distiller’s aspiration to enhance the maritime notes in this expression. Refill and rejuvenated casks have both contributed to its maturation. The nose is youthful but rounded, with brine, burning wood embers, vanilla, and honey. Sweet and spicy on the palate, with cranberries and black currants, while peat smoke is always present, plus black pepper. The finish lingers, with walnuts and fruity peat. £40",
"The Exclusive Malts 8 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 2005 vintage (Cask  #484), 55.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"This veteran Balblair was distilled on February 7, 1969 using barley malted on site and coal-fired stills. Just 999 bottles have been released. Opens with slight saltiness on the nose, almost ozone, then lemons and pine, and finally, vanilla fudge. Overt citrus notes on the palate, with aniseed, some oak, brittle toffee, and a smokiness not found in younger Balblairs. The finish is long and discreetly spicy, notably cinnamon and black pepper.",
"Signatory (distilled at Balmenach) 1988, 55.6%",Single Malt Scotch,89,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"Blended whiskies have taken a sexy turn for the better, and there have been some excellent attempts to innovate. Indeed, a gap has opened up between main label blends and this sort of thing, which is particularly brave because a world-class brand has let amateurs loose on it. That said, this is massive, with big earthy spice, peat, and sour fruits. There's some youthful sappiness in the mix, too, but it's not detrimental. Brave and impressive.  ",
"Lp4 Elements of Islay (distilled at Laphroaig), 54.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,108,101 to 500 Dollars,"A very welcome arrival from new owners Ian MacLeod, this has been aged in sherry
wood. As a result, you can’t help comparing it to Macallan and while there’s
none of the oily depths, there are fragrant top notes of honey and apple before
some resin and warm leather develop, but no sulfur. Some of the richness is
lost with water, so I’d leave it as is. This is a stunner for a 10 year old and
is marked accordingly. Value Pick £34  ",
"The Maltman (distilled at Ben Nevis) 17 year old, 49.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Even with a refill sherry cask, bright fruit is the main theme to this whisky: strawberry-rhubarb pie, red raspberry preserve, red currant. But there’s honeyed malt for balance, along with suggestions of
coconut macaroon, marzipan, brine, and glazed ginger to keep things interesting. Distinctive. (U.S. exclusive)",
"Tweeddale 12 year old Batch 3, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,68,0 to 100 Dollars,"Pronounced “Pot Doo,” this is without doubt a rugged coastal and/or island whisky, but on a mild and temperate day. Salt, spice, and peat are all to the fore, but it’s a gentle giant of a whisky, with some citrus drizzle and a light honeycomb heart. The main wood influence seems to soften the delivery so that the punch it packs won’t floor you. Beautifully put together, though.",
"Exclusive Malts (distilled at Linkwood) 14 year old 1999 Cask # 978, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,105,101 to 500 Dollars,"Initially, this is Macallan in effusive Willy Wonka mood, with lots of toffee, chocolate, greengage, and light oiliness. The aroma thickens with water, and with it a more serious mien: brogues buffed to a high sheen. The palate is equally rich and layered, with cereal, black cherry, discreet oak. A complex mix, as befits a gentleman’s dram that every gentleman should have. £95",
"Glenfarclas Family Casks 1974 (Cask #8579), 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,89,1052,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Immediately identifiably Longmorn: that ridiculous, highly amenable mix of soft fruits, masses of sweet spice, candied peels, coconut, and sticky toffee pudding. In fact, it’s almost over the top in its lushness. Leans into the mouth with masses of mace, then soft fruits and marzipan develop. Unctuous, long, and ripe, the wood shows just a little, but the depth and richness holds it in check. Very good. £97",
"Ar4 Elements of Islay (distilled at Ardbeg), 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,151,101 to 500 Dollars,"A mélange of casks and techniques that only Jim McEwan knows about. The fourth iteration of his Black Art manages to mix mature notes of beeswax-burnished church pews, a sprinkling of rose water, dried mango, rosehip syrup, and potpourri. The palate opens to Parma violets, underpinned with light lavender, where fleshiness mingles with the exotic notes of manuka honey, pomegranate, apricot pits, and dried lemon. It pushes malt into a new area, but that’s the point. £200",
"Lp5 Elements of Islay (distilled at Laphroaig), 52.4%",Single Malt Scotch,89,118,101 to 500 Dollars,"Chapter II of Arran’s The Devil’s Punch Bowl embraces whisky from a total of 27 casks. These are seventeen oloroso sherry hogsheads (from 1997 and ’98), six standard bourbon barrels (2002), and four peated bourbon casks (2004). Juicy dark berries, malt, and soft cinnamon on the nose. Robust and fruity on the palate, with more dark berries, plain chocolate, a suggestion of vanilla, and black pepper. Long and drying in the earthy, mildly smoky finish, with aniseed and licorice.",
"Glenglassaugh Massandra Connection 41 year old Sherry Wood Finish, 44.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,1087,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Described as the smokiest whisky produced at Talisker, Dark Storm is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets, and maturation has taken place in deeply charred casks. Rich, fruity spices on the nose, quite citric, with brine and aromatic smoke. The smoke elbows its way to the fore in time. Full, sweet, fruity flavors on the palate, some vanilla, then smoke, licorice, and spice hit home. A classic Talisker smoke and chili finish, but cranked up a notch or two! £45/1 liter",
"Arran Malt 17 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"More obviously sherried on the nose than either Sigurd or Ragnvald; buttery, with figs, sultanas, vanilla, a hint of leather, and ripe oranges. Rich and silky on the complex palate; overt sherry, ginger, and lots of old leather and sweet smoke. Spice is quite muted here. The finish is lengthy, with plain chocolate, wood smoke, figs, and tingling spices. Luxurious and accomplished. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €1,000",
"Craigellachie 19 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,168,101 to 500 Dollars,"Caol Ila in unpeated guise. There’s no age statement, but what you get is a mix of the fresh and the mature: a vibrant attack with fresh Victoria plum, grapes, and a hint of oiliness. Give it time and the sensation is like afternoon tea at your auntie’s, with thickly-buttered scones dripping with honey or pineapple jam. The palate is equally sweet and gentle, and only needs a little drop of water to reveal light spice. A wee beauty.",
"Ardbeg Kildalton, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,191,101 to 500 Dollars,"The Millennium Casks is a non-chill filtered vatting of 45 Arran casks filled on December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000; 35 bourbon barrels and 10 sherry hogsheads. A spicy, floral nose with sherry, honey, coconut ice, orange, fudge, and ultimately raisin notes. Smooth and luscious on the palate, with apple pie and custard, plus a sprinkling of cinnamon. Long and spicy in the finish, with oranges, a hint of black pepper, licorice, and drying oak. (7,800 bottles). £65",
"Bruichladdich Bere Barley 2008, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,89,83,0 to 100 Dollars,"The first Diageo Special Releases Oban to be released since 2004 has been matured in rejuvenated American oak and second-fill bodega casks. The outturn is 2,860 bottles. Tinned peaches, ginger, caramel, and newly-sawn wood on the nose, with an accompanying marine note. Syrupy in the mouth, very sweet and spicy, with nutmeg, cinnamon, and baked apple. Contrast is provided by a splash of brine. Spicy in the drying finish, with ginger to the fore, plus more sea salt.",
"Glengoyne 26 year old Single Cask Distilled 1987 (Cask #384), 54.6%",Single Malt Scotch,89,557,501 to 1000 Dollars,"This limited edition release of Glen Garioch is the first from the Aberdeenshire distillery to have been matured entirely in oloroso sherry casks. Just 1,000 cases of the 14 year old expression are available globally. Old leather, slightly earthy, sultanas, white pepper, and a hint of lemon pith on the nose. The palate is big and bold, with more pepper, plus cinnamon caramel, orange, and abundant sherry. Enduring spice, licorice, and slightly smoky raisins in the finish.",
"Exclusive Malts (distilled at Ardmore) 14 year old 2000 Cask #233, 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"This whisky shows no signs of immaturity considering its age. Indeed, enjoying Laphroaig young and at a higher strength is the best way to appreciate the distillery’s true character. Very medicinal and “closed up” neat, but comes alive with a splash of water. Powerful notes of tar, charcoal, smoked seaweed, and licorice root, mercifully tamed by ripe barley and honeyed malt laced with vanilla. Warm, smoky, charred oak finish. (U.S. only)",
"Arran The Devil’s Punchbowl III The Fiendish Finale, 53.4%",Single Malt Scotch,89,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"It’s a crying shame that this great distillery is so rarely seen. Here, a bourbon cask has reduced the meatiness and amplified the fruity component, but these are fruits with depth and power, allied to dried flowers. The mango-like sweetness is reduced to syrup; there’s light plum jam and some old paper. Sweet on the tongue, with crystallized ginger, apricot, and a finish of spice, and the strange sweetness of licorice root. (The Whisky Exchange only.) £84",
"Double Barrel Ardbeg & Craigellachie, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"A very tarry start, like fence posts which have just been treated with creosote. Add in some smoked fish alongside dried grass, and you have all the requisite elements for a classic Laphroaig. The palate is massively smoky to start, a real peat bomb, but that eruption recedes, allowing barley and sweetness to come through. This is a serious dram which needs water to coat the tongue. Very good. £65/500 ml",
"Port Charlotte PC12, 58.7%",Single Malt Scotch,89,168,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 17 year old independent bottling of Ben Nevis has somewhat unusually been matured in a fino sherry cask, rather than the more common oloroso or PX.   The nose offers initial milk chocolate notes, then a whiff of cold roast pork and oak. In time, strawberry and mango aromas appear. The mouthfeel is pleasingly full, decidedly gingery, with caramel and dry sherry. Spicy, mild sherry and raisins in a long, lively finish.",
"The Whisky Exchange (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 16 year old, 55.6%",Single Malt Scotch,89,114,101 to 500 Dollars,"Alasdair Day is on a mission to build a new Lowland distillery in the Borders of Scotland. While we wait, the next batch from his grandfather’s cellar book is a pale, golden dram with a delectable nose of lemon meringue pie, spring blossoms, peach pit, candy floss, and Valrhona Ivoire white chocolate. This is more-ish whisky: like spooning into panna cotta. Pear syrup, white chocolate, and a sizzle of toasted muffins dissipate into a mild ginger and gooseberry finish. £40",
"Wemyss Malts Cacao Geyser (distilled at Bowmore) 1998, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,124,101 to 500 Dollars,"From a Speyside distillery whose malt is more commonly found in blends. An enticing and complex nose balances sweet honey, acidic dried orange, rich walnut, and light smoke. On the palate these elements come together well with complexity and balance. Things get spicy in the mid-palate, with black pepper, salt, ginger, and a bump in smoke. A long finish rounds everything off, showcasing smoke and orange. Lots of character and flavor for an uncommon malt. (U.S. only)",
"Wemyss Malts The Rockpool 1995 vintage (distilled at Bowmore), 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,89,180,101 to 500 Dollars,"Although from a refill, the mahogany color suggests a short previous use. Some nose burn, with a mature edge of leather and dark chocolate. Here’s Glenfarclas in a darker guise, with raisin and a savory aspect; think roast pheasant and walnuts, lamb and mint sauce. The palate is big, thick, and sweet with lots of extract, but also Turkish delight, sultana, and prune. While sherried, it’s not in any way overcooked; the tannins are balanced, the sweetness massive. £625",
"Glenturret The Brock Malloy Edition, 46.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,313,101 to 500 Dollars,"A touch of damp dunnage, some Ardbeggian soot, and plenty of jalapeño-style heat. Shows maturity and depth of character, with just-dead bonfire, ointment, and a sweetness, which here is like honeycomb. Water makes it bolder, with deeper smoke, while the palate has sweet wood, balanced (cigar-accented) smoke, and layers of salt, angelica, and plum. £90/500 ml",
"Ledaig 42 year old, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,5450,5001 to 10000 Dollars,"Bold, with smoked fish (Arbroath smokies), dried fruits. Has requisite density of character with classic notes of freshly-laid tarmac and medicine. A lemon edge adds some lift. The complexity continues on the tongue, which is very juicy; vanilla-accented but with plenty of seaweed-like smoke that shifts into licorice. Long, balanced, and thick in the center, with some (smoked) dried thyme on the finish. £70/500 ml",
"Springbank Marrying Strength 10 year old, 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,66,0 to 100 Dollars,"The Massandra winery, which supplies casks for Glenglassaugh’s Massandra Connection bottlings, is the oldest in Crimea, and reputedly produced Tsar Alexander III’s favorite wines. The 1973 distillation, which has been finished in sherry casks, has a nose of sultanas, cinnamon, sweet grass, and herbal notes in the background. Bung cloth, char, and finally damp undergrowth. Complex aromatic progression. Mouth-coating, with sweet, spicy tropical fruit notes and oloroso. Slowly drying, with bitter orange and mild tannins at the close. £645",
"Springbank Sherry Wood 17 year old, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"As Arran continues on its trajectory toward introducing an 18 year old expression, just 9,000 bottles of sherry cask-matured 17 year old have been released. Bottled at 46%, it has not been chill filtered. Sweet and fruity on the nose, with ripe pineapples, green apples, malt, and a hint of licorice. Luscious and nicely-textured on the palate. Lots of orchard fruits, sherry, and soft toffee. Mild spice and hedgerow fruitiness in the slightly drying, lengthy finish.",
"Compass Box The Peat Monster Cask Strength Magnum, 57.3%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,188,101 to 500 Dollars,"Here, Craigellachie is slimmed down and appears in slightly leaner guise, with an aromatic spritz of vetiver-heavy male cologne coming across first before fresh fruits follow on. More crisp and with slightly more obvious toasted structure. The pineapple distillery character is now dried, before the palate shows sweet chocolate pudding, char, honeysuckle, herbs, and white fruits. A classy (and large) package. (Travel Retail only) €135/liter",
Glenfarclas £511. 19s. 0d.,Single Malt Scotch,89,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Not an unpeated Ardbeg, but a new initiative to raise money for the Kildalton Project which supports community projects in south Islay. Smoke, but also real sweetness: hothouse peaches, mezcal, smoked oyster, sphagnum moss, a huge hit of vetiver, and coal tar. The smoke flies to the throat before fogging forward, while the sweet core (with added raspberry and cream, and mint) moves to the back. A worthwhile dram and a hugely worthwhile cause. Buy for either reason; or both. £120",
"Caol Ila Unpeated 1997 17 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015), 55.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"Bere is an ancient strain of barley which is stubbornly difficult to grow and mash. For this, Bruichladdich has gone to a specialist farm on Orkney. The nose is intriguingly aromatic, sweet and slightly corn-like, with a sweet nuttiness behind. It becomes very floral (night-scented stocks) with white currant, lemon sherbet, and a lift of tangerine before water brings out sakura (cherry blossom) syrup and bread. The palate is very sweet and concentrated. Remarkable. Keep watching. £52",
"Port Ellen 1983 32 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015), 53.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,3700,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"This 26 year old single cask Glengoyne was matured in a first-fill European oak sherry butt that yielded 339 bottles. It offers a nose of sultanas, figs, and vanilla, plus white pepper and a hint of linseed. Succulent in the mouth, the palate yields sweet sherry, honey, and contrasting lemon juice and pepper. The finish is lengthy, but dries rapidly, with lively pepper, oak tannins, and a final fatty note. £350",
"Johnnie Walker Select Cask Rye Cask Finish, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"If you needed proof that Scotch whiskies don’t fit neatly into established categories, look no further than this marine style, peated Highland malt. Sea salt, oyster shells, and light smoke lead the nose, with hay and apricot underneath. In the entry, the flavors burst on the palate with sea salt, honey, malt, oak, and smoke. Peat smoke really builds in the mid-palate but manages not to lose the supporting flavors, although it becomes the real star of a long finish. (U.S. only)",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt #2 (batch 1), 48.3%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,74,0 to 100 Dollars,"The third and final expression in Arran’s Devil’s Punchbowl trilogy of limited releases is a multi-age bottling, matured in eight oloroso sherry butts, eight French oak barriques, and five bourbon barrels. Only 6,660 bottles are available. Figs, dates, citrus fruits, and honey on the nose, with developing savory notes. Silky sherry, lively cinnamon, and red berries on the palate, with a hint of wood smoke. Lengthy in the finish, with spicy oak.",
"Wemyss Malts Kiln Embers, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,64,0 to 100 Dollars,"If I had to back one of the protagonists in Douglas Laing’s latest Duel of the Phial, my money would be squarely on the Ardbeg. The nose delights with oils oozing from the chestnut flesh of a grilled kipper, coiled rope on a trawler’s deck, and hot pressed asphalt, with a gentle background note of roasted peanut and millionaire’s shortbread. Medium texture: lemon and butterscotch, delicious fruitiness, and spearmint on the mid-palate. Clean, creamy with a baked lemon finish. £49",
"Glenrothes Vintage Reserve, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,89,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distilled in 2002, here’s Port Charlotte with an assured maturity. Amber in color, with some smoke and a pleasing whiff of cowshed (sweet hay and cow’s breath), before rosehip syrup and ozonic freshness. Water brings out incense, cream, even a little nuttiness. The palate is gently complex; a drop of water is needed to calm the heat and reveal the smoke that interweaves between the layers. It retains its fresh acidic finish, with nutmeg, soft lemon, and pear. Excellent. £110",
"Balblair 1990 (2nd release), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"Smoky! Can you get dessert seaweed? Because that’s what this smells of. Candied ginger notes alongside a distinct salinity—think winkles—and in time a hint of verjus, even lanolin with water. The palate shows balanced smoke, paprika, then white pepper. The best smoky Bunna’ I’ve come across, showing maturity, balance, and no rubberiness. In time, there’s notes of old (refill) sherry cask. Released for the 2014 London Whisky Show but still commercially available. £75",
"Last Drop Distillers (distilled at Glen Garioch) 1967, 45.4%",Single Malt Scotch,89,7000,5001 to 10000 Dollars,"Rich amber. A slight agricultural note to start, and although sweet and soft, also a little indistinct. This is a palate whisky, with plenty of integrated smoke, rich fruitcake, and, as its name suggests, plenty of chocolate. It fades quickly when neat. Water, surprisingly, rectifies this: the nose opens to show complex dark depths, while the palate is lengthened and given extra aromatic lift. Rich and rather lovely. £85",
"BenRiach Cask Strength (Batch 1), 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,89,86,0 to 100 Dollars,"A very solid and sound Bowmore with saline notes, some dried hot pepper, and masses of menthol, which give a buzzy, nose-cleaning effect. The smoke gently glides along throughout. The palate is quite thick and shows sweetness and a slow release of soft fruit, with a tingle of salt. The smoke slowly increases until it concentrates on the back palate, giving an effect like burning pine logs on the beach. Becomes nicely funky in time. Recommended.",
"Craigellachie 31 year old, 52.2%",Single Malt Scotch,89,718,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Cask # 328 was filled at Glenturret on December 16, 1986 by stillmen Hugh Malloy and Chic Brock. After 28 years of maturation, it has yielded 240 bottles. It is exclusively available online at thefamousgrouse.com. Boiled fruit sweets, heather, hazelnuts, old oak, and musty bung-cloths on the nose, plus slight mint. The palate is rich and fruity, with honey, rum, vanilla fudge, and ginger root. Spicy milk chocolate and coconut in the lengthy finish, with non-intrusive oak. Classic Glenturret. £200",
"Glenmorangie Milsean, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,99,0 to 100 Dollars,"This veteran Ledaig release from Tobermory distillery is the oldest to date, having been made in 1972. 500 bottles are available globally. Musty old leather, malt, and plum pudding on the slightly earthy, phenolic nose. In time the leather becomes suppler, with ripe figs and, finally, soot. Voluptuous in the mouth, with sweet sherry, plain chocolate, and soft spices, plus black pepper, an emerging note of coal. The finish is very long, with citrus fruit, chili, smoke, and subtle oakiness.",
"The Golden Age Blend, 44.3%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,503,501 to 1000 Dollars,"A number of ‘Marrying Strength’ variants of 10 year old Springbank have been released, retailing exclusively through the Cadenhead Whisky Shop in Campbeltown. The 2014 expression is bottled at 49.9%. Brine, new leather, and pipe tobacco on the nose, with developing caramel. Maritime characteristics are accentuated with time. Voluptuous on the palate, balanced, with sweet leather, peaty spices, and apricots. Long and slowly drying in the finish, with black pepper and rock salt. Quintessential Springbank, and the best 10 year old sampled to date. £42",
"Ballantine’s 30 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,380,101 to 500 Dollars,"Released in February 2015, this cask strength expression of 17 year old Springbank has been entirely matured in sherry casks. 9,120 bottles are available globally. The nose offers sea spray, blood orange, ginger, and discreet sherry. Finally, some peat. The sherry really makes its presence felt on the palate, which is full and slightly oily, with rich fruitcake flavors, soft toffee, coffee, and ripe cherries. The finish is lengthy, slightly peaty, with more sherry, treacle toffee, and trademark Springbank ozone.",
"Ballantine’s 17 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,69,0 to 100 Dollars,"Dry peats tossed on a driftwood fire with coastal aromas of sun-scorched seaweed beside high tide rock pools comprise this refined dram. A momentary glimpse of lighter lemon, lime, and pineapple is quickly snuffed out by the full strength assault. It’s like pulling the pin on a grenade. There’s a dense barrage of peat moss, worn leather, and cocoa at the death. Ride through it to glory. Possibly the highest ABV that Compass Box has ever given us. £120",
"Caol Ila 18 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 59.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"If you like sherried malts, you’ll love this! Bottled at a respectable strength too. Red apple, cherry skins, strawberry, raspberry, Eccles cake, malt loaf, and warming spices; there’s a lot to get your nose into here. A finely structured dram, with soft leather, rhubarb, Bramley apple, cherryade, fresh Victoria plum, pepper, and muted ginger deliver sustained flavors. A long, spicy, and peeled fruit finish. Given the distillery closures in 1983, there could be some interesting components in here. (464 bottles)",
"Tomatin Cù Bòcan 1988 Limited Edition, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,262,101 to 500 Dollars,"Aged in first-fill American oak, this shows a real brightness, crisp fruit, and some smoke—it’s not really unpeated—and wet grass, before moving into pear and tarragon. The palate is intense, with a hay note, then an almost fino sherry-like note before sashimi emerges. Reduced, there’s more of a soft flow, though there’s still a touch of green olive minerality. A steal at this price. Snap it up.",
"Jura Tastival, 51%",Single Malt Scotch,89,111,101 to 500 Dollars,"Matured in refill European oak sherry butts, this year’s Special Release has more weight than many previous expressions and a fascinating smokiness that comes across like a just-lit fire: fire lighter, burning paper, fire grate, and wood smoke. The more active oak adds walnut skin notes and rich dried fruits before the smoke returns. All very sophisticated with enough sweetness to balance. Excellent, but, ouch, that price!",
"The Exclusive Malts  (distilled at Invergordon)  42 year old 1973, 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,255,101 to 500 Dollars,"A zeitgeist Johnnie Walker fine-tuned for the American palate, this blend has a moreish nose of cinnamon, cocoa, and the toasted coconut of macaroons, mingled with strands of smoke, dried walnut, nutmeg, and an array of spicy rye anchored by a concentrated line of vanilla. Lots of American oak at play here. It’s elegant, dry, and smooth with vanilla, cinnamon, coconut, and flashes of spice. It’s fabulous sipped straight up but keep walking to the finish. Value Pick.",
"Peat Elements of Islay, 59.3%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,46,0 to 100 Dollars,"These Boutique-y blends are delivering terrifically good whiskies time after time, but the small batches sell through quickly now that the word is out. This one has plums, apple, mixed peel, spices, walnut, and sherry notes. The palate is fizzy, with plummy depths, chocolate shavings, ginger biscuits, and dark fruits with a medium-weight mouthfeel. This can go toe-to-toe with the best of ‘em. Once the ginger settles down it leaves a pleasing, mild maltiness. Add water if you must. (370 bottles) £49",
"Cragganmore, 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,89,600,501 to 1000 Dollars,"This is so much more than a pumped-up version of Peat Chimney; this has sweet smoke from singed green wood twigs, light honey, peach, all balanced with TCP-soaked bandages. Nothing harsh or off-putting, it’s just a delight. Sweet honey, orange, generous malt, and caramel, but it’s the smoke coiling its way throughout that makes the greatest impression on the palate and finish. These blended malts tend to move quickly, so grab one while you can. Perfect for winter drinking. (12,000 bottles) £42",
"Exclusive Malts 2005 Ledaig (distilled at Tobermory) 11 year old, 57.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Like its elder sibling, Loch Lomond 12 year old is presented in non-chill filtered form, and in this case, matured in a mix of bourbon, refill, and recharred casks. Ripe apricots, vanilla, and a suggestion of peat smoke on the nose.  The full palate offers oranges and pears, plus developing spicy malt and mild peatiness. Long in the finish, with spicy fruit notes. Drying, with subtle tannins.",
"The Half Century Blend, 45.5%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,749,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The oldest of Bablair’s current core bottlings was distilled in 1990, and after maturing for 21 years in bourbon casks it was transferred to oloroso sherry butts for a further 2 years prior to bottling. Citrus fruits, furniture polish, cloves, cinnamon, and parma violets on the nose. A silky mouthfeel, spicy, with dark berries, dates, and rich sherry. Slowly drying, with aniseed and dark chocolate in the finish.",
"BenRiach 22 year old Moscatel Wood Finish, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,180,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is the first single malt to be released by the Last Drop Distillers, and the Aberdeen-shire veteran is old-style, well-peated Glen Garioch. Unusually, it was matured in what the bottlers describe as “a bourbon-style remade hogshead cask.” Just 118 bottles are available globally. Fruity and herbal on the nose, with apples, marzipan, ginger, linseed, and a hint of camphor. Complex and distinctive. Surprisingly vibrant fruit notes fill the perfumed palate, with allspice, before it starts to become tannic. Ultimately very mouth-drying, with subtle smoke, and a fatty spice note at the very end.",
"Speyburn 25 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"Remember those remarkable 20+ year old BenRiachs that appeared when the distillery reopened which we thought were gone forever? Think again. This new and keenly priced arrival has sweet malt on the nose, followed by mango, orange blossom honey, and Portuguese custard tarts. It needs a little water to calm the alcohol and help to spread an already thick texture along the tongue. A sweetly spicy and creamy hit toward the end. Marked within its competitive set. £60",

Obviously an old whisky, but a delicate one that has subtle complexities; the balance between the dried grass/hayloft, the dried orange peel, and stewed apple, for example. Sweet and fragrant, it shows chypre notes with water alongside a more gentle floral aspect. The palate is drier than the nose suggests, quite mineral, with a lacy character. The finish shows melon and mint. Glen Grant in gentle repose.£88",

This year’s batch thrusts equally boldly, but starts in a more Japanese-accented fashion: think soy, miso paste, and salmon teriyaki. Light leather, with hickory campfire smoke coming through strongly. The big, oily, tarry palate is like a spent barbecue with a hint of skidding car tires on Bowmore High Street.

"Glenrothes, 1991 Vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"This balances sweetness, vanilla, and smoke extremely well, and I found it preferable
to Monkey Shoulder for sipping neat. On the palate, there’s sweet smoke from
blackened oak logs, fragrant spices, a well-developed vanilla note, and a hint of

This is signature Ardbeg: young (but not too young), bold, and with an attitude too! Its flavors are reminiscent of crumbled peat thrown on a campfire, with notes of damp earth, pepper, and seaweed.

It’s a delicious whisky, with clean, ripe, sherried fruit marrying nicely with the dry oak spices. Notes of apple pie, honeyed summer fruit, caramel toasted almonds, and toffee, with dry resinous oak on the finish to round out the sweetness. A big, full-bodied Balvenie that satisfies.",
"Cadenhead's, (distilled at Littlemill), 1989, 61.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,115,101 to 500 Dollars,"This whisky combines the finer qualities of both the 18 year old and the 25 year old. It expresses the balance and purity of the 18 year old, while showing maturity found in the 25 year old. The lack of chill-filtering enhances the whisky’s vibrancy and, like all the Benromachs, it’s mouth-coatingly thick and malty.",
"Scott's Selection 30 year old 1974 vintage (distilled at Macallan), 52.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,230,101 to 500 Dollars,"Gold color. Citrus zest aromas and creamy sweet notes-reminiscent of lemon meringue pie-with subtle tropical fruit and marshmallow notes dancing throughout. This whisky has great balance and is fully mature at 12 yrs., which should be no surprise for a Lowland whisky. The palate delivers what the aroma promises, with a touch of honey up front, citrus and vanilla in the middle, and a delicate dryness on the finish. I've always admired Bladnoch-a whisky that needs to be better known-and this expression reinforces my opinion.",
"The Macallan 30 year old Fine Oak, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,650,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Pale gold/straw color. Fresh, appetizing aroma and flavor of brine, delicate peat, gentle sweetness, and a touch of spice and seaweed. Medium in body and slightly oily in texture. Nicely balanced and clean, with a salty, dryish finish. This is a lovely, very appetizing expression of a distillery that has been closed and dismantled. (It was the original Clynelish distillery.) It is a very nice example of a northern Highland whisky, and expresses a great balance between sweetness and brine, youth and maturity. However, I would have liked to have seen it bottled at a higher strength.",
"Wild Scotsman (distilled at Mortlach), 1994 vintage, 13 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Like the Clynelish 14 year old also reviewed in this issue, it is nice to see Diageo finally introduce official distillery bottlings of Caol Ila here in the U.S. (after being available in the UK for many years now). My suitcases were getting quite heaving on my return trips from Scotland. This is a splendid Coal Ila. It is wonderfully vibrant. Understandably, the immediate impact on the palate is the peat smoke, but there's so much else going on here, too: smoked olives, seaweed, salt and pepper, all placed on a gently sweet bed of toffee and vanilla fudge. Lingering smoke, olives, and seaweed on the finish.",
"Springbank 10 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,88,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Amber gold color. An exciting aroma-classic Islay. It is very phenolic, reminiscent of standing downwind of a peat kiln. Interwoven spice (especially pepper), seaweed, and sweet & sour notes add complexity. Light to medium in body, but quite oily. Nicely balanced flavors of peat smoke, seaweed, salt & pepper, all wrapped up in a gentle sweetness. Lingering peat smoke and spice on the finish. Yet another example of Caol Ila's fine pedigree. This bottling has great balance, and I especially enjoy how the smoke and sweetness marry together. My only criticism is that it is a bit soft for Caol Ila. I would love to try this whisky at 46 or 50% ABV, which would give it a bit more guts.",
"Tomintoul 27 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,175,101 to 500 Dollars,"A rounded and mature affair. The 25 years in oak has made it a bit more refined (and drier on the palate) compared to younger expressions. All the classic Caol Ila notes are stillthere-mustard, seaweed, olives, damp peat, salt and pepper. A touch of vanilla wafer, anise, smoked almonds, and tarry rope add complexity. Those of you who prefer Ardbeg 17 over the 10, and Laphroaig 15 over the 10, will be attracted to this whisky when compared to Caol Ila's younger siblings. But at $225, it's an expensive date, isn't it?",
"Glenrothes, 1985 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"Caperdonich is always a challenge to find. This one is aged in a sherry cask. One would fear that slumbering away for 35 years in a sherry cask would completely dominate this whisky’s profile. Not this whisky. As you would expect, it is nicely matured, but it is surprisingly clean and well rounded, too! Exotic notes of dried fruits, sultana, subtle (but viscous) honey, sandalwood, and a potpourri of spice (especially cinnamon, anise, ginger). Clean, subtly spicy finish. Slowly sip and savor its delicate pleasures. 
",
"Tomintoul 12 year old Oloroso Sherry Cask Finish, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Lush and fruity-the sherry cask aging is obvious-and it is balanced beautifully by the dry, spicy oak notes. Through all this, there’s inviting notes of ginger, raisin, and a whiff of peat. One of the best Glen Ord whiskies I’ve tasted. 
",
"Springbank 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,190,101 to 500 Dollars,"Very fragrant. Spicy too, with notes of honeyed vanilla, peaches in cream, butterscotch, cinnamon, licorice (red and black), light nuttiness, and toasted oak on the finish. Nice mouthfeel, well-balanced, and quite rich for such an elegant whisky.",
"Jewels of Scotland (distilled at Caol Ila), 1984 vintage, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,88,170,101 to 500 Dollars,"Deep gold color. Exotic aroma of tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), vanilla, and honey. Medium bodied and firm. On the palate: honey, vanilla, and tropical fruit up front, becoming dry, with subtly complex spice notes. Deep, dry, lingering finish.",
"Benromach 10 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Lively on the nose for its age (and on the palate too -- the tell-tale oak emerges only towards the end). Notes of creamy vanilla, barley sugar, coconut, pineapple, and general citrus notes throughout. Dried spices (especially cinnamon) kick in mid-palate and continue into a lengthy, dry, polished oak finish.",
"Caol Ila 'Unpeated Style,' 10 year old (2009 Release), 65.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Deep gold color. This whisky is finished off in new oak, and it certainly shows. There are lots of complex wood spices in this whisky, and it is intensely deep and mature for such a young age. There’s a firmness to the whisky that’s very appealing. It is exciting too, with notes of toasted oak, vanilla, and a hint of dark chocolate.",
"Cardhu, 1997 vintage, 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,406,101 to 500 Dollars,"The newest expression from the 1990s. Heavier, richer, and more ripe that the 1987 Vintage reviewed above. It is very creamy and mouth-coating, with layers of sweetness (vanilla, caramel, light toffee, white chocolate), fruit (sultana, plum), along with a good underpinning of oak spice. A very nice effort for a whisky this young. 
",
"Jura Prophecy, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Amber gold Aroma: Full and creamy. Floral, honey, fruit gum drops. Palate: Rich and mouth-coating. Clean. Nicely balanced. Notes of vanilla, honey, and assorted fruits up front, followed by spicy oak notes, with a dried fruit finish. 
",
"Tomatin, 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Richly sherried, great mouthfeel, and well-balanced. The sherry is clean, and is only one facet of this multi-dimensional whisky. Notes of lush orange and apricot, soaked in molasses and maple syrup. Fig cake and oak resin add structure and complexity. Dry, spicy cinnamon, resinous finish. (Bottled for Delilah’s, and for Bull and Bush)",
"GlenDronach 1989 vintage, 19 year old, 58.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"Honey, creamy vanilla, caramel, sultana, and toasted almond along with a hint of lemon gum drops and banana. Quite floral, too -- lavender, heather -- with a gentle, lingering finish. A very soothing, mouth-coating whisky with excellent balance, while still quite fresh. Indeed, a very more-ish whisky -- and sneaky in how it grows on you with each sip.",
"Springbank 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"An elder Lagavulin. Thirty years of oak aging has mellowed this whisky. Fragrant and floral, with suggestions of perfumed soap. Spicy too, with cinnamon and anise. Classic leafy, smoky notes, along with some tarry rope, emerge on the palate and maintain a steady keel as they work their way through an ocean of vanilla malt. Lingering finish of burning embers. Certainly an enjoyable Lagavulin, but I still like the standard 16 year old better. It’s hard to improve on a classic.",
"Caol Ila, 25 Year Old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,205,101 to 500 Dollars,"Straw gold color. Peat smoke, damp earth, seaweed, balanced by a maple syrup sweetness on the nose and palate. Full-bodied and firm in body. Flavors are pleasantly mature and nicely integrated.",
"Balblair 1997, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Pungent and medicinal in personality, with gobs of peat, tar, iodine, brine, and seaweed. These are all good things.in case you were wondering. A gentle vanilla sweetness tries to tame this savage beast, but it is no match. One of the most challenging-yet rewarding-whiskies in the entire world. What Cantillion Lambic is to beer, Laphroaig Original Cask Strength is to whisky.",
"Mackillop’s Choice (distilled at Glenlivet) 1977 vintage 30 year old (Cask #19786), 43% ",Single Malt Scotch,88,180,101 to 500 Dollars,"Pale gold color. Bold aromas of sweet wort, seaweed, and peat bonfires. Medium bodied and slightly oily in texture. Malty sweet flavors up front, followed by peat and seaweed, then taken over by a huge rush of peat smoke that never seems to end. A sweetness stays with the whisky throughout to help balance the peat smoke.",
"Glenmorangie Finealta, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Also known as St. Magdalene, this Lowland distillery which closed down for good in 1983 is becoming increasingly more difficult to find. And when one does become available, it will be pushing 20 years old or older, like this one. When young, Linlithgow often exhibits a freshness and drinkability, with a gentle maltiness and often hay or grassy notes for complexity. How does this older one fare? Quite well, actually. I was concerned that this whisky would have too much oak influence, given how old it is and how delicate the whisky can be. While those years in a hogshead add some dry spicy notes, they are never excessive. Instead, they add a complexity that blends in nicely with notes of creamy malt, vanilla, lemon gum drops, grass and hay. I am particularly impressed by the evolution of flavors on the palate and the length and depth of its dry, spicy finish. Certainly one of the best Linlithgows to come onto the market. 
",
"Jewels of Scotland (distilled at Dailuaine), 1973 vintage, 31 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,88,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"One of the better bottlings from this Lowland distillery which closed in 1983. Velvety and slightly oily in texture, and fragrant. The whisky is balanced, the flavors clean, with no hint of excessive oak. Bourbon cask-aging offers up notes of vanilla wafer, along with coconut cream, honey, and a touch of caramel. Bright fruit (lemon meringue, pineapple, apricot) keeps the whisky lively, and suggestions of hay and linseed offer continued entertainment. Nutty, toasted oak finish. If you are looking for a Linlithgow (AKA St. Magdalene) to purchase before the whisky becomes impossible to find, I can recommend this one. 
",
"Tomatin, 1982 Vintage (Cask #92), 57%,",Single Malt Scotch,88,553,501 to 1000 Dollars,"White wine color. Sweet aromas of confectioner’s sugar, toasted marshmallow, honey, and coconut. Its flavors mirror its aroma, with a pleasing creamy, almost buttery, texture and soft, gentle finish. 
",
"Caol Ila 12 year old, 57.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,79,0 to 100 Dollars,"Quite fresh and lively for its age and loaded with fruit. You’ll find bright fruit (tangerine, passion fruit, lemon) followed by subtle, sweeter fruit (coconut, honeydew melon, banana, and apple crumb pie). Resinous, minty oak notes and a hefty viscosity give the whisky some structure, while floral notes (lavender, rose petals) and gentle vanilla expose a softer side to the whisky. Dry, oak finish.",
"Bladnoch 17 year old, 46.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"The nose is muted, with gentle orchard fruits, subtle malt, nougat, and nutty toffee. The palate, by contrast, is bold and offers big fresh fruit notes, notably zesty tangerines, along with crème brûlée. Dry peat notes follow. Earthy peat smoke and white pepper with a citrus tang in the long finish. (230 bottles)",
"Wemyss Vintage Malt Ginger Compote, 1996, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,84,0 to 100 Dollars,"This whisky shows the true potential of Mortlach -- and at a youthful age, too! Quite fragrant and very complex on the nose and palate. Chewy toffee with almonds, vanilla fudge, ripe barley, and nougat, with underlying pit fruits, dried spice, and a hint of leather on the finish. Very fulfilling.",
"Bruichladdich Sherry Edition Oloroso 1998 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Intensely fruity and floral on the nose, like a rosebush-lined berry patch; there’s also shortcake with lemon drizzle, almonds, and orange peel. With water, the fruit character deepens and takes on an edge of marzipan. The palate fizzes with citrus and soap flavors, tempered by milk chocolate, tobacco, and bitter leather. Without water, it’s intensely drying, though with it, the character turns cloying: Tread carefully. (134 bottles; U.S. exclusive)",
"Glengoyne 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Very similar in flavor profile to the Tomintoul 16, reviewed below, but better. The longer aging has provided extra character and depth. Also, on the palate, the caramel flavors are a bit darker (bordering on toffee) and the whisky’s finish is longer and a shade drier. It has aged gracefully, with no excessive woodiness. A whisky that reveals its charm slowly and subtly. 
",
"Adelphi (distilled at Glenrothes) 1990 20 year old, 58.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,124,101 to 500 Dollars,"Richer, thicker, and more lush than the 1975 vintage reviewed here. Fallen orchard fruit, sticky toffee pudding, and nuts, with underlying suggestions of date cake. Emerging dried spice and oak resin towards the finish. A good contrast to the 1975 vintage.
",
"Balblair 1989, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"The subtle sherry adds an additional level of complexity when compared to the standard 10 year old, taking Tomintoul to a new level. Rich and creamy, with well-balanced notes of toffee, vanilla fudge, toasted nuts, and elegant fruit. A surprisingly delicious whisky for 12 years old.",
"Chieftain’s Choice (distilled at Rosebank) 20 year old, 54%",Single Malt Scotch,88,170,101 to 500 Dollars,"Nice to see stocks distilled after the 1980s ‘silent period’ turning 18 years old. The sherry influence here is complementary, but not overpowering. Notes of toffee almond, vanilla fudge, chocolate-coated citrus, bramble, and candied ginger. Polished leather, dried spice, and a hint of brine on the finish dries it out nicely and keeps it interesting. Not quite as dynamic and complex as some of those legendary pre-1980s Springers, but it’s smooth, well-rounded, and more-ish.",
"Scotch Malt Whisky Society (50:42) 18 year old, 56.9%",Single Malt Scotch,88,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Bottled in 2004 and still in circulation. A very traditional Caol Ila. Not a heavy-bodied whisky, but it throws a strong punch. Notes of tarry rope infused with seaweed and brine, all on an oily, malty, vanilla foundation. Throw in some orchard fruit, Manzanilla olive, black licorice stick, and soot, with brine and Tellicherry pepper on the finish. Clean, fun, and dynamic.
",
"The Famous Grouse Celebration, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,126,101 to 500 Dollars,"The first 10 year old release containing whisky produced entirely by the new owners. I love the interplay here between the malt, sherry, and smoke, with all getting a chance to shine. A rich vanilla-tinged malty foundation, deep caramel, rhum agricole, an array of lush fruit and dark chocolate, along with grassy/hay notes, honeysuckle, subtle spice (cinnamon, anise), and lingering earthy smoke. A vast improvement from the “Origins” release last year. I would only make three changes to make this whisky even better (and elevate it to 90+ status): a couple more years on oak, bottling at 46%, and not chill-filtering it. Still, this is one of the best efforts from this distillery. Well done!",
"The Balvenie 40 year old (Batch #2), 48.5%",Single Malt Scotch,88,3982,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Caol Ila makes unpeated whisky for blenders, but it rarely gets bottled as a single malt. Here’s a very revealing opportunity to find out what Caol Ila tastes like without the smoke. Good viscosity and rather sweet, showing thick, honeyed vanilla, gobs of fruit (lemon drops, lime tart, ripe Bartlett pear, kiwi), mint jelly, and cut grass. Its sea influence finally emerges towards the finish with brine and just a hint of seaweed. Bruichladdich and Bunnahabhain are now bottling peated whiskies, and Caol Ila does just the opposite. This is an interesting diversion, but I am missing the added dimension of peat smoke in this Caol Ila.
",
"Glenrothes 1988, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"Matured in a bourbon cask. Cardhu has always been a pleasant, but uninspiring, whisky to me. This is one of the best Cardhu whiskies I’ve tasted -- richer and more distinctive. (At this price, it had better be!) It’s clean and tight, with orange, tangerine, lemon gumdrops, ginger, delicate honey, butterscotch, and vanilla, with a dusting of powdered sugar. Straightforward, pleasing finish. (252 bottles)  £250",
"The Whisky Exchange Elements of Islay Kh1 (distilled at Kilchoman), 59.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Like “Superstition,” this is a peated expression of Jura. Compared to Superstition, Prophecy seems richer, heavier, sweeter, deeper, leafier, with more tarry notes. I’m also picking up more spice (cinnamon, anise, dark chocolate) and some fruit (lime, mandarin orange, green apple), with a subtle yet intriguing suggestion of burnt popcorn. Prophecy is also bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered—which I think brings out more subtle nuances and texture in the whisky. The only tradeoff is that I’m picking up less of the Jura spirit and less sea characteristics. But this is a small tradeoff, considering how much more you’re getting with Prophecy. Promoted as a limited annual release.",
Wemyss Malts ‘Honey Spice’ (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 1991 (bottled 2011),Single Malt Scotch,88,96,0 to 100 Dollars,"A new, beefed-up version of the 18 year old, with a higher alcohol level and (seemingly) more sherry influence. I must say that I really enjoyed the previous expression, rating it an 87 for its roundness and elegance. I like this one too, and its bold demeanor. Whether you like it or its predecessor comes down to preference and mood. Notes of toffee apple, pancakes drizzled with maple syrup, date nut cake, ripe fruit, and roasted nuts, all dusted with cinnamon, vanilla, and cocoa.",
"Balblair 2001, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,53,0 to 100 Dollars,"The first single cask release of GlenDronach for the U.S. by the new owners, and a nice one at that. Silky in texture, polished, and clean on the palate, with light toffee, treacle, cherry bonbon, orange-soaked date nut cake, and chocolate-covered raisin. Never cloying, like some heavily-sherried whiskies can be. Silky, soothing finish. Surprisingly soft and youthful for its age. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)",
"Glenmorangie 15 year old Nectar d’Or, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,62,0 to 100 Dollars,"A good dose of sherry here, but there’s plenty of Springbank character coming through too! Gobs of ripe, red berried fruit (strawberry, rhubarb, red currant, raspberry), especially on the nose, along with raisin. It’s all on a bed of blueberry pancakes, toffee, and fig cake. Coconut and brine emerge occasionally on the palate and linger on the finish. A very nice whisky, although I wonder what it would taste like with just a little less sherry influence?",
"Ballantine's Christmas Reserve 2011, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,37,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is to be a permanent addition to the core Caol Ila range, but it will raise a few eyebrows, completely ignoring the current peat battle between Ardbeg and Bruichladdich and heading off into an altogether more refined and delicate direction. This is a dignified and complex malt, which doesn’t give everything up immediately. There’s soft pear and guava on the nose, and the trademark oiliness and distinctive peat are there, but there’s a buttery quality, too, as well as some brine and spice, apple pip, and traces of aniseed. You get a sense of its age late on, with some oaky tannins and sharper spice, but overall this is an unhurried, complex, and sweet whisky with just enough peat to keep it honest. Very impressive. (Limited general releases, excluding the U.S.) ",
"Lagavulin Distillers Edition 1995, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,77,0 to 100 Dollars,"Very fruity (peaches in syrup, pineapple, golden apple, sultana) and satisfyingly rich in texture, with coating vanilla, marzipan, and a potpourri of dried spice (especially on the nose and finish of the palate). Great balance too. Nicely done!",
"Springbank Rundlets & Kilderkins, 49.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,89,0 to 100 Dollars,"Once again Lorne Mackillop demonstrates his talent for selecting whiskies with beautiful balance. This time it’s with a well-aged Glenlivet. Sure, it shows many of the notes that I often find in Glenlivet (Speyside elegance, peachy vanilla, tropical fruit, floral and honeyed-malt notes), but I’m also picking up more subtle notes: dark chocolate, licorice root, dark fruit, perhaps even charcoal (especially on the finish), making the whisky a bit more complex and curiously attractive.",
"Glenmorangie Artein, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Glenmorangie enters the world of peated whiskies (like everyone else these days it seems — not that I’m complaining). Richly textured layers of sweetness (vanilla, toffee, milk chocolate), fruit (tangerine, orchard fruit — especially ripe cherry), roasted nuts, wild morels, a hint of menthol, and gentle smoke. Certainly entertaining, even if the whisky doesn’t always seem to know what it wants to be. The soft sweetness mid-palate is balanced nicely by dried spice and smoke on the finish. Curiously enjoyable.",
"The Dalmore Cromartie, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,88,156,101 to 500 Dollars,"A robust Speysider — and very tactile too (clinging to the palate), but with no excessive oak. Vanilla and some dark chocolate notes along with coating (yet ironically dry-ish) honey notes. But its biggest flavor note is citrus — particularly lemon, along with some tangerine and a hint of pineapple — which helps to cut through the thickness. Good depth, with dried spice, polished oak, and a wisp of smoke on the finish. (Bottled in 2004, but only recently released to the U.S.)",
"BenRiach Authenticus 25 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,195,101 to 500 Dollars,"Aged in a refill sherry puncheon, and the sherry is evident in appearance and on the palate. Soft and sweet, with caramel-coated mixed nuts, toffee apple, rhum agricole, currant (red and black), plum, cinnamon, and surprising brisk mint (especially toward the finish). A pleasing, non-aggressive expression of a mature, sherried whisky. (Not available in the U.S.)£340",
"Black Grouse Alpha Edition, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,41,0 to 100 Dollars,"Unusual, insofar as this is the one chance a year that drinkers get to try Caol Ila’s other expression: the unpeated version, which — and here’s a bit of history for you — helped save the distillery during the lean period of the whisky loch in the early 80s. Rather than this just being Caol Ila with the peat stripped out, the team made  it in a different fashion — but there are still hints of commonality. 
For example, the grassy note that usually lies beneath the smoke is the lead aroma here, and it’s not any old grass, but wet grass — like skidding on a football (soccer) field. The mind keeps looking for smoke, but apart from a hint of birch smoke (which could come from the (refill) cask), it’s whistle-clean and fruity, and with a touch of water, fills with an aroma of toffee popcorn, custard, and pears. 
The palate continues in this light fashion with melon balls and fruit cocktail. This potentially bland fleshiness is given a perkiness thanks to the high alcohol and, again, a jag of acidity. Bizarrely, on the finish, I pick up slight saltiness. A fun dram. ",
"Double Barrel Ledaig/Bowmore, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,49,0 to 100 Dollars,"The first Tempest to be imported to the U.S. Aged exclusively in first-fill bourbon casks. With the bourbon cask, and relatively young age, you can really feel all the Islay love. Bracing, with plenty of sea character, along with honeyed vanilla, citrus, floral notes (especially lavender), rumbling peat smoke, tobacco, and resinous oak on the finish.  A bit steep in price for a 10 year old, but very dynamic.",
"Auchroisk 30 year old Special Release 2012, 54.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,359,101 to 500 Dollars,"The Wemyss range — overseen by Susan Colville — has been quietly building a deserved reputation for being among the most consistently enjoyable single cask bottlings. This new example hails from the mighty Benrinnes distillery, but shows a milder side to its make — there is indeed ginger aplenty, along with cumin, crystallized fruit, and jellied peach, but behind is a deep earthy and slightly leathery note typical of ‘The Ben.’ It’s these bass notes that dominate on the richly chewy palate. Best neat. £51 ",
"Longrow Red, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,88,79,0 to 100 Dollars,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

The freshest of the bunch, chock full of Springbank character. Light and lively. Floral, with plenty of fruit (green grapes, kiwi, apple tart) on a bed of honeyed malt. Nuttiness and brine emerge toward the finish, and linger. ",
"Arran ‘The Devil’s Punch Bowl,’ 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Probably the most highly-regarded malt in the regular Glengoyne lineup, the 17 year old represents a direct progression from its younger siblings. According to the distillers, “The balance has artfully changed. A more concentrated palate of flavors has emerged…” Citrus and cedar notes on the slightly grassy nose, with a hint of plain chocolate. Medium in body, with more plain chocolate notes, plus raisins, orange, vanilla, and malt. Lengthy in the finish, with milky coffee, sherry, leather, and citrus spice.",
"Old Pulteney WK499, 52%",Single Malt Scotch,88,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"The nose is redolent with the smells of autumn jam — slowly stewing dark berry fruits — but there’s a hint of hazelnut adding a drier edge alongside some waxed paper. As it opens, out comes argan oil. This constantly changing array of aromas is very Glenrothes, as is the vanilla lift when water is added, which comes with added cordite. The palate is very sweet, filled with fruit syrups and even some dried rose petal. The finish, long. £79",
"The Macallan Sienna, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,103,101 to 500 Dollars,"Matured in second-fill bourbon casks, this expression of Balblair offers a distinctive aroma of bananas, along with cooking apples, sultanas, nuts, and spices. It is full-bodied and exhibits a palate of toffee and spicy fruits, and becomes increasingly chocolate-y, with distinct cocoa notes, when given time to breathe. Raisin notes also develop. The finish is lengthy and smooth, with lasting lively spice and vanilla.",
"Springbank 14 year old Manzanilla Cask (#259), 54.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Gold color. Soft, delicate aroma of fruit gum drops, vanilla, and a touch of honey. Light in body, with a soft texture. Its flavors are like its aroma, nicely balanced, with a gentle finish. 
",
"Arran Premium Sherry Single Cask (Cask 1979), 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,88,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Distilled in Scotland’s most southerly distillery of Bladnoch in October 1992, this bottling has been matured in a refill hogshead, and 150 bottles have been allocated to the U.S. It presents a fresh nose, with initial herbal notes, turning to cornflakes and newly-mown hay. Sweet and fruity on the palate, with oat biscuits and milk chocolate. The finish is relatively short, with spicy custard, then a final fruit flourish. ",
"Balblair 1997, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"Available only at the distillery or online, and limited to 5,000 special decanters, this is a special Famous Grouse release to mark the 30th anniversary of the blend. Be careful, though:  it's not a 30 year old blend. But it is excellent and there's lots of very old, woody, and ripe malt in the mix. As Highland Park and The Macallan are in the stable, expect a fruity, oaky, superbly balanced treat.  £80",
"Glengoyne 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,109,101 to 500 Dollars,"The darkness of the hue of this, the second official release of a 40 year old from Balvenie, gives an indication of how intense the relationship between cask and spirit has been over its long sequestration. It emerges brimming with dense aromas such as tamarind paste, treacle, and Black Forest gateau. Amazingly, on the palate there’s a lift of vanilla-like sweetness before the heavier and drier elements close down on the finish. Incredibly limited; only 150 bottles produced. £2,500",
"Old Pulteney WK217, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,62,0 to 100 Dollars,"The hue is deep amber and the nose is equally resonant and rich. This is Glenrothes in its most muscular guise, so that while you have the normal layers of fruity complexity, there is an extra weight. Think of citrus peels, sticky dates, walnuts, and fruit leather. The palate is soft and rolling with light tannin. For me, it’s at its best au naturel.",
"Johnnie Walker The Spice Road, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,43,0 to 100 Dollars,"You’d hardy expect Kilchoman to be able to spare casks for independent bottlings, but somehow TWE’s Sukhinder Singh has persuaded Anthony Wills to part with one of his precious babies. It exhibits classic Kilchoman notes of clove and fresh scallop, backed with subtle peat, chamomile, and lint. With water, a typically young, peaty aroma of rubber develops (so drink it neat). It shows the huge potential of this distillery. £50 (500 ml)",
"Grant’s 25 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,294,101 to 500 Dollars,"Bunnahabhain, along with Bowmore, is Islay’s greatest user of ex-sherry casks; a throwback to the days when it was part of Highland Distillers. Its rich, thick, and ginger-accented spirit matches the attention of European oak extremely well. In this red tea-colored example, you have resin, saddle soap, ginseng, and treacle toffee on the nose, and a fusillade of roasted spices on the palate before the finish reveals sweet gingerbread. A big huggable bear. £60",
"Dailuaine 16 year old Flora & Fauna, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Balblair 2001 Vintage is the first distillery bottling to be non-chill filtered, noncolored, and offered at 46%. It is 10 years old and has been matured in ex-bourbon barrels. The nose offers lemonade, vanilla, allspice, and developing milk chocolate and caramel notes. Clean and straightforward on the palate; sweet and spicy, with tangerines, eating apples, toffee, and more milk chocolate. Cocoa powder in the spicy, relatively lengthy finish. £33",
"Arran Malt 16 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"Previously offered as a 12 year old, it now has an extra three years of secondary maturation, after a decade in ex-bourbon casks. The ‘finishing’ casks are ex-Sauternes barriques. Lemonade, icing sugar, vanilla, nougat, and maple on the nose. Progressively sweeter. Rich and sweet on the palate, notably fruity, with spicy orange and brittle toffee. Medium length finish, with milk chocolate-coated ginger and lingering toffee. £39",
"Te Bheag Blended Whisky, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"Master blender Sandy Hyslop has deliberately attempted to capture Christmas in the glass, and so it should come as no surprise to find a rich, full, and flavorsome whisky with sherry trifle, red berries, orange fruit, and mince pie filling in the mix. It's put together with grace and style, mixes well, and is that rare beast — a blend that can be enjoyed on its own.  ",
"Duncan Taylor Dimensions Range (distilled at Tormore) 2005, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,88,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"It’s a brave person who tries to persuade a malt like Lagavulin to go into a different direction. Indeed, even PX casks, from the sweetest fortified wine of all, can’t fully obscure the distillery’s character, just give it a raisined coating. The creosote turns to tar and licorice, while there’s Syrah-like sootiness, and damson. This release is slightly less sweet than in the past and is the better for it, though I still prefer my Lagavulin relatively ‘naked.’",
"Glenrothes Elders’ Reserve, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,158,101 to 500 Dollars,"Springbank has released a limited edition of 9,000 bottles of whisky distilled in November 2001, matured in small casks (traditionally known as rundlets or kilderkins), and bottled in January 2012. The small casks have left an impression of accelerated maturity, with coal smoke, cloves, young oak, and caramel on the rich nose. The palate is big and bold, with a sprinkling of salt, then more youthful wood, milk chocolate, and honey, while the finish is long and slightly tarry. £57",
"Glenrothes Manse Reserve, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,54,0 to 100 Dollars,"Artein is the third release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition range, with ‘artein’ being Gaelic for stone. The expression comprises two-thirds 15 year old and one-third 21 year old whisky, finished in ‘Super Tuscan’ wine casks. Briefly pear drops, then vanilla on the nose, with developing peaches and apricots, shot through with mild ginger. Viscous, mouth-coating, intense, dark fruits, spice, aniseed, and late onset of cloves and blackcurrant cough medicine on the palate. The finish is fruity, long, and herbal.",
"The Macallan Coronation (Spanish Oak Cask #190952), 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,567,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The Dalmore Cromartie was distilled in 1996 and has been matured in oloroso sherry casks. The release is limited to 7,500 bottles. A floral nose with cocoa powder and warm leather, along with hand-rolling tobacco and gingery, citrus notes. Rich and elegant sherry notes on the palate, with soft, smoky treacle and dark chocolate-covered orange candy. The finish is long and spicy, majoring on cinnamon, with more dark chocolate, overripe orange, and a hint of licorice. £100",
"Wemyss Malts Salted Caramels (distilled at Glen Scotia) 1991, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,145,101 to 500 Dollars,"Though sounding more like a character out of Asterix than a whisky, Authenticus is the code for the peated arm of the ever-expanding BenRiach portfolio. It’s the smoke that you notice first, typically Highland-style wood smoke with a light aromatic lift akin to smoked meat. It’s not a bludgeoning smoke however, because BenRiach’s inherent orchard fruit sweetness is there alongside touches of beeswax. In other words, it has maturity. The key here is balance and harmony. £124",
"Berry’s Own Selection (distilled at Jura) 1976, 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,88,322,101 to 500 Dollars,"Arguably the most successful of the Famous Grouse extensions (well, the competition includes Snow Grouse, for Pete's sake!), the Black Grouse brought ever-popular peat into the mix, a move that was followed by a peatier version of Johnnie Walker Black Label. The label says this is richer and peatier, and it is. But this scores most for a chicory/coffee and liquid licorice undercarpet that makes it very palatable indeed. Neat over ice. (Travel Retail exclusive)€33",
"Highland Park Ragnvald, 44.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,539,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The question with this sort of blended malt is whether the whole outperforms the sum of its parts. This is a big, rich, oily, and peaty whisky, suggesting both the Ledaig—the peated version of Tobermory and often a bland malt—and the Bowmore—capable of big smoke notes when it wants to—are firing on all cylinders. There's not much subtlety to it, but it's enjoyable all the same.€40",
"Old Pulteney Navigator, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"The original Singleton, seemingly discarded as a single malt, rides back defiantly with this bottling. The start shows cherrystone, but there’s an immediate deepening into mature notes of roasted chestnut, varnish, and sweet leather, but always sufficient caramel sweetness to balance. The palate starts sweetly and any grip is dissolved with a drop of water, which also extends what otherwise is a quick fade. Old yes, oak yes, but layered and good.  ",
"Auchentoshan 1975, 45.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,820,501 to 1000 Dollars,"This 11 year old bottling of Longrow from Springbank distillery was matured for seven years in refill bourbon casks before being filled into cabernet sauvignon hogsheads for a final four years. 9,000 bottles are available. The nose offers buttery smoked haddock, coal tar soap, citrus fruit, and new leather, with background notes of soft peat. Mouth coating, with rich peat on the palate, plus fruity spice and developing licorice notes. Long in the finish, with persistent peat smoke and, finally, red currants. £50",
"Wemyss Malts Merchant’s Mahogany Chest (distilled at Glen Scotia) 1991, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"6,660 bottles of The Devil’s Punch Bowl have been released, and the component whiskies come from 24 casks filled between 1996 and 2006. They include a number of sherry butts, and some peated spirit is included in the mix. The nose offers soft, mellow malt, dried fruits, and milk chocolate. Silky smooth and deceptively drinkable at full strength, the palate is nutty and notably fruity, with ginger and brittle toffee. A hint of barbecue sauce in the sweet finish.",
"Springbank 14 year old Oloroso Cask (#268), 56.2%",Single Malt Scotch,86,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Orange marmalade color. Aromas of ripe fruit (orange, strawberry, red raspberry), caramel, and toffee, with a subtle, Spanish oak resin spiciness. Medium to full in body with a silky texture. Nicely balanced on the palate and very well integrated flavors similar to the aromas. Silky smooth finish. 
",
"Springbank 12 year old Cask Strength 2014 release, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,76,0 to 100 Dollars,"When approached from light to rich, you can see how the driver of the range is oxidation rather than just the addition of wood. Here are stewed black cherries, red plums, and blueberries, but with the purity and freshness of Amber and Gold. The mental image is of a country house in autumn: clay on boots, candle wax, resin, allspice, peels, those perfumed fruits, and the whiff of an artist’s palette. The tannins are supple. Best with water on the side. £66",
"Douglas Laing Directors’ Cut (distilled at Rosebank) 21 year old cask #10146, 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,676,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Part of an ongoing series, and the first appearance of Port Charlotte. This ain’t shy. Assertive with banana, roasted red pepper, paprika, and a hit of barbecued pork glazed with pomegranate molasses. The palate has blazing heat, but also oiliness and real density. The peat doesn’t so much rumble as sit there in a cloud: opaque, impenetrable. Even water cannot unlock it. Rooty and tarry, this is not a dram for the fainthearted. £65 (500 ml)",
"The Famous Grouse 40 year old, 47.3%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,3378,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Isle of Arran distillers is now offering exclusive bottlings in the U.S. along the same lines as those already available in the UK, starting with 16 year old single cask, cask strength variants. Arran Premium Sherry Single Cask #1979 displays milk chocolate, vanilla, new leather, wood polish, and butterscotch on the nose. More vanilla in time. The palate is richly sherried, with espresso, fruit loaf, nutmeg, and old wood. Lively spices persist in the lingering, leathery finish.  ",
"Glenfarclas Family Casks 1985 (Cask #2591), 45.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,480,101 to 500 Dollars,"Following the initial release of a 1997 vintage Balblair in 2007, a second edition has now been launched, with the spirit in question having benefited from an additional five years’ maturation in first-fill bourbon barrels. Fresh, light, and fruity on the nose: tinned peaches, pear drops, sweet apples, plus vanilla and wood putty. The palate features lots of succulent soft fruits, milk chocolate, honey, and spice. The finish is medium in length, and spicy chocolate notes persist. £55",
"Exclusive Malts 2001 (distilled at Bowmore), 58.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"This variant of Glengoyne replaces the popular 17 year old as part of an overhaul of the core range, and the maturation regime has included what the distillers describe as “a generous proportion of first-fill sherry casks.” Milk chocolate, vanilla, melon, and grapefruit on the nose, with burgeoning dry sherry and fruitcake. The palate is rich and well rounded, with cinnamon and ginger, almonds, orange marmalade, sweeter sherry, and caramel. Lingering spices and easy-going oak in the lengthy finish. £70",
"Master of Malt Darkness! Clynelish 16 year old Oloroso Cask Finish, 54.9%",Single Malt Scotch,88,126,101 to 500 Dollars,"WK217 is the latest in Pulteney’s Travel Retail-exclusive range of releases named after the registrations of fishing vessels. This expression has been matured in a mix of Spanish and American oak sherry butts. Fig rolls, black treacle, sultanas, and a hint of cinnamon on the nose. Finally, milk chocolate. Smooth and oily on the palate, with soft spices, before deeper and darker sherry notes arrive. The finish is relatively long, with sherry and spice, then final spiky licorice notes. £40 (liter)",
"Glenglassaugh Massandra Connection 35 year old Madeira Wood Finish, 41.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,665,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Somebody at Diageo has been taking a lot of interest in the Johnnie Walker range of late, what with the revamp of the core range and now a regular stream of special releases. This is the first of a series for Travel Retail only, but it takes the Johnnie Walker themes — vanilla, spice, and honey, with wispy peat and smoke — and adds savory spice to the earthiness. But there are some very young notes in this. ",
"Wemyss Malts (distilled at Glenrothes) 1988 Aromatic Orange Tobacco, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,188,101 to 500 Dollars,"I was surprised to find that Grant’s blends were noticeable by their absence in the U.S. But with the purchase of Tuthilltown in New York and Tullamore Dew in Ireland, that is slowly changing; and here's proof. Beautiful, honeyed, rich, but the 40% ABV makes it the whisky equivalent of a radio DJ cutting off “Freebird” before the solo at the end. Still great, and indeed better than most competition, but not the classic it could be.",
"Aultmore 25 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,636,501 to 1000 Dollars,"These days the mighty Mortlach is a known quantity, but Diageo’s two other meaty sites—Benrinnes and Dailuaine—remain in the shadows. This is big, boisterous, and sherried, but there’s less of the gravy-browning elements you get from the other two; at Dailuaine it is fruit that is promoted alongside Seville orange, treacle, and the inevitable raisin and date. There are nods to PX sherry as well. Every bit as good as Mortlach.  £43",
"Kilkerran Work in Progress 6 Bourbon Matured, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"As it progresses toward the ultimate goal of an 18 year old expression in 2015, Arran has released a 16 year old, matured in 30
percent sherry hogsheads and 70 percent bourbon casks. The edition is limited to 9,000 bottles. The nose features malt, milk chocolate, and honey, with a citric edge. The palate mirrors the nose with more malt, honey, and milk chocolate, plus ginger, nutmeg, and spicy oak. Spiced fruits in the lengthy finish.",
"Exclusive Malts (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 26 year old 1987 Cask # 2784, 47.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,230,101 to 500 Dollars,"Pronounced “Te Veg,” this has its roots in the Isle of Skye, and as there’s only one distillery there it’s highly likely that the odd
drop of Talisker has found its way into the mix. Whether it has or not, this is stirring stuff, non-chill filtered so that the flavors burst forth. As you might expect, it’s rugged with brine and chili, giving it a distinctive spice edge. But the delivery is a caramel fudge delight, with luxury chocolate praline in there too.",
"Clynelish Select Reserve (Diageo Special Release 2014), 54.9%",Single Malt Scotch,88,800,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Is this bottled by Duncan Taylor or Ben & Jerry’s? Ludicrous amounts of white/milk chocolate and macadamia nut, with green fennel underneath. With water, it opens into dark chocolate chunks (see what I mean?) and cappuccino. One sip makes you worry you’re putting on weight, such is the thickness of its impact. Okay, it’s more about the wood rather than the distillery, but you can’t deny that it puts a smile on your face. Completely bonkers and somehow wonderful. £49",
"Old Pulteney 1990 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"As befits an elder of the church, this has a serious attitude, which with the youngest component being 18 years old isn’t a surprise. Full-bodied, but with elegance, not bludgeoning power, this is a refined Rothes: malted barley, creamy oak, oxidative depths. Sweet with stewed plums and red fruit. The palate is unctuous with little hints of geranium and becomes slightly funky with water, though I’d go neat to get the full effect of bitter orange and sweet honeycomb. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €99",
"Old Pulteney 40 year old, 51.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,2280,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"The youngest of the Manse Brae triumvirate, and also the freshest. Here is Rothes at its liveliest, with sweet cereal and the typical spiciness of the distillery undercut by citrus peels, dessert apples, and hot malted milk. On the tongue it is quite delicate, but it is how it behaves mid-palate which is the killer, just stopping and allowing the fruits to liquefy in the center of the tongue. Fantastic price as well. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €40",
"Cadenhead’s (distilled at Glendullan) 17 year old, 57.4%",Single Malt Scotch,86,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"A sherry butt this time, which has allowed the whisky a little more space to breathe. Although as concentrated as you'd expect here, we can see more fragrance emerging and a big-boned elegance is on show — think Margaret Dumont. I pick up some rose hip syrup, dried apple, Armagnac/prune, and a licorice note, as seen on the ’62; while on the palate, a good balance of rich chocolatey sweetness to offset the tannins. Big but balanced. £512",
"Compass Box Great King Street Glasgow Blend, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"Just 279 bottles of this 22 year old single cask Glen Scotia have been released by Wemyss Malts, with maturation taking place in a bourbon cask. Fleetingly, very sweet, crunchy apples on the nose, then caramel, milk chocolate, sherbet dips, plus a hint of brine. The palate is sweet and peppery, with spicy toffee, grapefruit, melon, and walnuts. The finish is medium in length, spicy, with table salt in the tail. £90",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky #1, 50.3%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,91,0 to 100 Dollars,"This expression of Jura is by leading London wine and spirits merchant Berry Bros. & Rudd, and was bottled in the company’s Berry’s Own range at 35 years of age after maturation in sherry hogshead #889. The nose offers sweet sherry and caramel, sultanas, cinnamon, and rum baba, with an elusive wisp of smoke. Full-bodied, very fruity on the palate, with mixed spices, pine cones, and old sherry notes. The finish is long, nutty, and luxurious. £200",
"The Pearls of Scotland (distilled at North of Scotland) 1971, 43.3%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,262,101 to 500 Dollars,"Pear drops, green apples, lots of toffee, and more spice on the nose than in the Sigurd expression; also fresher and fruitier. Voluptuous mouthfeel, with sherry, toffee, vanilla, nutmeg, and a wisp of fragrant smoke. Toffee remains in the finish, with notes of cocoa powder, smoky oak, and citrus spice. Very well balanced.(Travel Retail exclusive.) €400",
"Storm, 43%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"Navigator honors Old Pulteney’s seafaring heritage and promotional links with matters marine. The expression carries no age statement, is non-chill filtered, and has been matured in a mixture of bourbon and sherry casks. The nose features vanilla, sherry, American cream soda, ginger, orange peel, and cocoa powder. Complex. Mouth-tingling spices: ginger and nutmeg on the palate, with more oranges, and cocoa. Dries slowly, slightly powdery, with persistent citrus fruit, and a hint of brine. Value Pick.",
"The Balvenie Single Barrel Traditional Oak 25 year old, 47.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,599,501 to 1000 Dollars,"This 38 year old Travel Retail-exclusive expression has been aged in bourbon casks, and not chill filtered. It follows an initial batch of the same vintage, released in 2011. The nose is perfumed, with a resin note and developing vanilla and caramel popcorn. Demerara sugar and oak. Very fruity on the palate, with oranges and lemons, emerging spices, and benign oak. Long in the finish, with fruity oak. The additional maturation has given the fruity elements a greater profundity. (500 bottles)",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Miltonduff) 20 year old, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,88,113,101 to 500 Dollars,"The latest single cask expression of 1991 Glen Scotia from Wemyss Malts has been matured for 22 years in a sherry butt, which yielded 807 bottles. The nose provides sherry and cigar boxes, cherries, sultanas, raisins, orange peel, plum pudding, and finally warm leather. Full bodied, with sherry on the palate, plus brine, dried fruit, bitter coffee, and polished old, dark oak. Medium to long in the fruity finish, with salt, plain chocolate, and wood polish notes. £105",
"Ben Nevis 15 year old 1998 (Cask #590), 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"This bottling of triple-distilled Hazelburn comprises spirit produced in 2003 and matured in unusually small casks known as rundlets and kilderkins. Malt, chocolate, and honey figure on the nose, along with a contrasting marine note in the background. Unctuous and rich on the palate, with soft fruit, almonds, brittle toffee, and lots of spice. The finish is lengthy and earthy, with caramel and vanilla notes ultimately being superseded by oak and sea salt. £60",
"Label 5 Extra Rare 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,62,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is the seventh batch of 12 year old cask strength Springbank to appear, being bottled early in 2014. Some of the component whisky was matured in oloroso sherry casks. The nose blends maritime notes with Christmas cake fruits, vanilla pods, and overt sherry. Viscous in the mouth, with cowsheds and soft peat smoke, plus spice, caramel, and a hint of sweet sherry. The no-holds-barred finish presents a big blast of smoke, root ginger, and freshly-dug peat. £45",
"The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Ben Nevis) 15 year old Highland 1998 (cask #1589), 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,88,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"This example of Rosebank was distilled in March 1992, a year before the distillery’s closure, and bottled in December 2013. The cask yielded 141 bottles. The nose is light and mildly floral, with ripe pears, honey, and vanilla. Firm and fruity on the surprisingly full palate, with a sprinkling of white pepper, plus summer berries and caramel. Tropical fruit, soft spices, and benign oak in the finish, with a final flourish of licorice. £400",
"Glenmorangie Tùsail, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,111,101 to 500 Dollars,"Legendary master blender John Ramsay handpicked the casks for this whisky, and the job was completed by his successor, Gordon Motion. Puffy marshmallows, nougat, fallen orchard fruit, green cardamom, and clove; it’s like all the threads pull together harmoniously. A lucid concentration of fruit mingles on the tongue, preceding flavor advancement through spearmint, menthol, light peat smoke, and burning orange oils. Sit back as it heads toward a spicy tingle of ginger, apple, and scorched coriander seed. Deservedly famous. £2,000",
"Highland Park Odin 16 year old, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,270,101 to 500 Dollars,"A refill sherry hoggie has given a classic walnut color, and indeed notes of that nut as well. Here’s Glenfarclas at its most dense, with savory, sun-dried tomato-like edges and sandalwood. The mouth is elegant with a little heat, the sherry giving roasted almond, sweet plump dried fruits, and dried flowers. Water brings out lightly gripping tannins (but, again, not aggressively) and good layering. Similar to the ’87. £285",
"Talisker 2003 Amoroso Finish Distillers Edition, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,81,0 to 100 Dollars,"A sweet start, then a sudden blast of fresh, menthol-like toothpaste (pleasant) before it dips into slightly decaying soft fruits (again, nice), a mashy note, then violet-accented smoke. Water adds some elegance and weight. This sweetness continues on the palate, where there’s toffee, raisin, ripe fruits, and slow-burning peatiness, fully integrated and ember-like on the back palate. The finish is all hot peppered mackerel. Recommended. (U.S. only)",
"BenRiach 10 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Darkness! is a range of cask strength single malts which have been finished for 3 months in 50-liter first-fill oloroso or Pedro Ximénez casks. Waxy on the nose, with dates, prunes, cherries, cocoa powder, window polish, and finally vanilla. Warm and spicy on the palate, with sweet sherry, hot chocolate, intense tropical fruit notes, and cloves. The fruit becomes more citric in the finish; nutty, with clove oil. £75",
"Br5 Elements of Islay (distilled at Bruichladdich), 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distilled in October 1991, this 20 year old Private Collection expression of Balblair spent 40 months of secondary maturation in casks sourced from Crozes-Hermitage, the largest AOC in the northern Rhône wine-producing region of France. The nose offers red currants, sultanas, vanilla, and white pepper. The palate is initially soft and sweet, with summer fruits, but gradually darkens and dries. The finish features dark chocolate and raisins. 2,000 bottles.",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Laphroaig) 14 year old, 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,142,101 to 500 Dollars,"Highly fragrant and citric, mixing dried and sweet orange peels, moist sultana fruitcake. Lightly malty with gentle nuances of fruit syrup. Pretty and elegant in the mouth, where there’s orange barley water, mint, and crystallized ginger on top of a thick, honeyed delivery before the classic ‘Rothes sweet spices come through. Only a drop or two of water is needed. Recommended. £117",
"Johnnie Walker Black Label 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,30,0 to 100 Dollars,"A wild aromatic opening — anise, sweet cicely, even a hint of wormwood — with more oak than the 21 year old, but not in a dominating fashion, rather just a framing device. Still fresh and acidic, with touches of a bridal bouquet, freshly baked warm sponge cake, walnut flesh, and, with water, a little bread-and-butter pudding. The acidity gives it a zippy, clean palate zestiness with cumin and angelica. Beautifully balanced. £400",
"Kilkerran Work in Progress VII – Sherry, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"As with its sherry wood-matured sibling, this 10 year old release comprises 9,000 bottles and was distilled using the same lightly peated malt and bottled without chill filtration. Lemongrass, a pinch of salt, wood smoke, and ginger snaps on the nose. Tropical fruits on the soft, slightly oily palate, with a slight underpinning of spicy smoke. Nutty, drying, with mellow spice in the finish.",
"The Dalmore Distillery Exclusive 2015, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,88,229,101 to 500 Dollars,"Peated whiskies definitely have a dropping off point where they become too old and tired, and the nose for this one would indicate it’s past its prime, with gravel, rubbery smoke, and raisin. On the palate it’s a different story, as ashy smoke combines with raisin and rancio, turning the peat age detriment into an asset. Strangely alluring, it’s like sitting on a park bench next to a weathered old man who ends up having a real tale to tell.  (U.S. only)",
"Tomatin 36 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,780,501 to 1000 Dollars,"This Clynelish is notable as the first no age statement Special Release, and maturation took place in refill European and bodega European oak casks, along with first-fill, refill, and rejuvenated American oak casks. The nose is fresh and salty, with olives, pine, and lemongrass, then fruit notes ranging from citric to sweet. Oily on the palate, with those same citric and sweet fruits as the nose, plus cayenne pepper and vanilla. Spicy citrus fruits in the drying finish.",
"Royal Brackla 16 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"An unusual vintage bottling of Old Pulteney, in that maturation occurred in a mix of American bourbon casks and Spanish sherry casks that previously held heavily-peated whisky. The nose opens with a whiff of ozone; then lemon, vanilla, and coconut appear, along with fleeting wood smoke. Intense tropical fruitiness merges with milk chocolate, lemon sorbet, and lively spices on the palate. Spicy milk chocolate with a citric and softly peaty tang in the finish.",
"Ballantine’s 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions – Glenburgie, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Old Pulteney’s 40 year old comprises spirit from three sherry hogsheads and one bourbon barrel. Just 493 bottles of the distillery’s oldest expression to date have been released, offered at cask strength and not chill filtered. The nose is soft and fragrant, with peaches in syrup, toffee, cinnamon, and aerosol wood polish. Early intense orchard fruits on the palate, then nutmeg, cinnamon and black coffee. Long in the finish, with spicy oak tannins and Seville orange. Notably drying.",
"Bruichladdich Octomore 7.3, 63%",Single Malt Scotch,88,180,101 to 500 Dollars,"Distilled in 1992, a year before Rosebank fell silent, this 21 year old expression was matured in refill American oak casks. 4,530 bottles have been released. The fragrant nose yields milk chocolate, peaches, apricots, nutmeg, and toffee bonbons. Spicy and mildly herbal on the palate, with icing sugar and a suggestion of dark chocolate. The finish is medium in length, fruity, with gentle spice, coffee, and developing oaky dryness.",
"Clynelish Select Reserve (Diageo Special Releases 2015), 56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,88,815,501 to 1000 Dollars,"A ripe proposition, the fruit and the smoke locked tightly together like interwoven fingers. Peaches, melon, baked apple, fresh mango, and sugar strands with a supporting role of red berries. With a malt content exceeding two-thirds, the full-bodied palate is sweet as brown sugar, with mandarin tartness, apple, and red licorice meandering to a vinous finish of red berry fruit. With its cheeky Glasgow landmark on the label, this permanent addition to the GKS range is pure gallus.",
"The Dalmore 30 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,88,2260,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"A smashing, rich sherry nose showcases rosehip, elderberry, scorched oak, pipe tobacco, roasted coriander seeds, and damp dunnage warehouses. The core of the flavor is the lush orange jelly hidden in McVitie’s Jaffa cakes, combined with clove, malt, treacle, dried mango, and ginger. Water draws out stronger performances from the malty notes, together with some red berry characteristics. Let it roll around the mouth, it’s terrific stuff (Batch 1, 148 bottles). £57",
"Chivas Regal 25 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"The North of Scotland distillery (formerly Strathmore distillery) was a neighbor of Cambus and operated from 1957-1980 in Clackmannanshire. Bottlings are few and far between. This one is quite forward. Apple peelings, baked apricot, cinnamon, nutmeg, sherry notes with oak wood, beef stock, and adhesives. It tastes sweet, vibrant, and juicy with red berry fruits, rosewater, strawberry cream soda, cherryade, and cough linctus. A slightly bitter finish punctures the juiciness. (310 bottles for UK, Europe, Scandinavia, and Japan) £165",
"Benromach 35 year old Heritage Collection, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,610,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Treacle tarts, black bun, and polished antique furniture, with fainter accents of dark chocolate, espresso, and delicate smoke flowing freely from the glass. Densely structured palate. Initially, chocolate-coated coffee beans, then it blossoms into dried fig, date, with a developing deep, tangy chocolate orange note, fading to dusty cocoa like the memory of a warm embrace. Not to be confused with Cutty Sark, this Storm is bottled by the Whisky Shack Company.",
"Lagavulin 8 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Light gold, with good intensity and a more noticeable malty note than is common with this distillery, as well as touches of daffodil and dried honeycomb. The wood influence appears minimal to start with, but more vanilla creeps through in time; water brings out almond milk. Opens into clementine peel, pomelo, then cooked dessert apple. The palate is clean and forward; even slightly hot when neat. Remarkably assertive for a 25 year old.",
"Ballantine’s 21 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,139,101 to 500 Dollars,"Pale gold. Lightly floral and perfumed. The impression of honey on warm buttered scones. As it opens, so this gentle complexity grows, and gives a sense of some substance. Water reveals a hint of malt, fruit syrups, and pear blossom. The palate is creamy and needs a drop of water to reveal the acid/sweet flavor of white currant, and a hint of marzipan. A classic example of a light whisky—and a distillery—which could easily be overlooked. Don’t. £74",
"Bunnahabhain Toiteach, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,66,0 to 100 Dollars,"This 2014 bottling of Ben Nevis illustrates how good the single malt can be with robust sherry cask maturation. Distilled in June 1998, it was filled into a fresh sherry butt and matured for 15 years before 582 bottles were released. Raisins, prunes, old polished leather, and roasted meat on the nose. The body is full, with the palate offering succulent dark berries, dates, raisins, and plain chocolate. Long and spicy in the finish, with cloves and rum raisin-flavored dark chocolate. £92",
"Kilchoman Fèis Ìle 2016 bottling (distilled 2007), 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,117,101 to 500 Dollars,"Rather elegant blend, with aromas of woodworker’s bench, salted cashew, and dried banana chips, all backed by gentle bonfire smoke. Creamy caramel toffee, Victoria sponge, red currant, raspberry, and more oak build into a thick, luscious mouthful. Any smoke drifts away in the initial seconds. Toffee and fruit linger, making a very lengthy finish. A masterful top of the range blend from La Martinquaise. Well worth seeking out. €55",
"Glenmorangie Tarlogan, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,82,0 to 100 Dollars,"A 15 year old port cask-matured Ben Nevis that is as genre-defying as it gets. Deep port notes combine with strong iodine, honey, and malt in an inviting nose. This whisky simply roars on the palate, with big jammy fruit combined with salt, iodine, and a dash of smoke. Everything comes together in the mid-palate, with an alluring core of ginger, honey, and malt. A long, flavorful finish wraps up a whisky with unique character and unmistakable appeal. (U.S. only)",
"Glenturret Fly’s 16 Masters Edition,  44%",Single Malt Scotch,88,124,101 to 500 Dollars,"Tùsail—apparently Gaelic for ‘originary’—is the sixth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition collection. It was distilled using floor-malted Maris Otter winter barley, once ubiquitous in the British brewing industry but now practically a rare breed. Oily on the nose, notably linseed, then becoming more floral. Cinnamon, ginger snaps, and faint new leather. Viscous on the palate, with poached pears, cloves, nutmeg, and polished oak. Drying, nutty oak in the finish. £76",
"Hunter Laing Old Malt Cask 1996 (distilled at Arran), 50%",Single Malt Scotch,88,115,101 to 500 Dollars,"Odin is the fourth and final release in Highland Park’s Valhalla Collection. It has been aged in a combination of first-fill Spanish oak sherry casks and refill hogsheads, with the former predominating. The nose yields cocoa powder, insistent spice, subtle sweet smoke, heather honey, and rum-and-raisin fudge. Rich and fruity on the palate, with lively dark spices, plus treacle and peat smoke. The lingering finish initially offers smoky sherry, then dries with licorice and oak. (17,000 bottles)",
"The Exclusive Blend 35 year old 1980, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"This expression was distilled in 2003 and after undergoing a period of finishing in amoroso sherry casks it was bottled in 2014. Fleeting green apples on the nose, before sweetening with figs, sultanas, red berries, and chili. Peat smoke finally makes its presence felt. Full-bodied on the palate, with spicy smoke, dark chocolate, peaches, and Jaffa orange; the additional fruitiness courtesy of the amoroso cask influence. Long and softly smoky in the finish, with ginger and lingering fruit notes. £55",
"Douglas Laing Rock Oyster Cask Strength, 57.4%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,61,0 to 100 Dollars,"This new member of the core range is wholly from stock produced by the distillery’s new(ish) owner. It has a gentle, sweet, honeycomb nose, with some banana, a little malt, and lemon freshness. The palate shows light honey/honeysuckle at the start and is well balanced, with maltiness and a signature spicy finish adding a dry counterpoint to the sweetness from the cask and a distillate with good weight. Good price as well. Lovely.",
"House of Hazelwood 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"There’s no doubt that this is from Glenlivet; there’s still that pure combination of fruit and flowers, now given a little nudge toward a more concentrated expression: the flowers are dried and heathery, the fruits tinned pineapple, windfall apples. An added cedar/nutmeg note adds to the complexity. Liquorous and tongue-clinging with custard tart notes before the autumn fruits come through. A sense of the curtains being drawn and a settling in for the winter. Recommended.",
"Kilkerran 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"Big smoke. Smoked fish, in fact, with some linked oily elegance, along with touches of hot tar and a cooked agave quality, adding a slightly sour/sweet element; then come poached pear and pepper. The palate is rootier, but always with this deep, clinging texture. As it moves it sweetens briefly, then comes creosote. Water gives the sweetness more space before the big phenols come powering back. It’s a barbecue in your mouth. Classic Laphroaig, in fact. £91",
"Blue Hanger 10th Blended Malt, 45.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"The latest single cask expression of Auchentoshan from Wemyss Malts is 14 years old and was matured in a bourbon barrel. The outturn is 342 bottles. The nose is fleetingly herbal; then offers crème de citron, turning to tinned peaches in syrup, and finally pine and peppery caramel. Silky-smooth in the mouth, spicy, with lemon and digestive biscuits. Freshly-squeezed lemon lingers in the chili and chocolaty finish. £78",
"The Glenrothes (Vintage Cask #3) 1998 Vintage, 58.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"Distilled in 2004, this 11 year old sherry cask-matured expression from Glengyle in Campbeltown is one of two final releases under the Work in Progress banner. 6,000 bottles have been released. Fragrant wood fires, fruity old leather, damp tweed, sherry, malt, and autumn berries on the nose. The palate is oily, rich, and rounded, with zesty spice, then peaches in syrup and sweet smokiness. The spices persist. The finish is long and warming with chili, licorice, and worn leather.",
"The MacPhail’s Collection 8 year old (distilled at Bunnahabhain), 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"Just 450 bottles of this year’s offering are available. Aged in a mixture of Madeira, muscatel, and port casks, with a final spell in first-fill bourbon barrels. Warm caramel, spiced orange, peach blossom, and black pepper on the complex nose. Nicely textured on the palate; initially fondant-sweet, then nutmeg, Jaffa orange, ginger, and milk chocolate emerge. Relatively lengthy in the finish, with sultanas, leather, a hint of plain chocolate, and lingering black pepper. £150",
"GlenDronach 14 year old Virgin Oak, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"Tomatin has introduced a permanently-available 36 year old expression, and the first batch comprises 800 bottles. Matured in a combination of bourbon and oloroso sherry casks, this expression has not been chill-filtered. Milk chocolate and vanilla on the early nose, with background apricots, malt, and ginger. Ultimately citrus fruit and sherry. Good mouth-feel, lively sweet fruits, cloves, and more ginger on the palate. Long in the finish, drying slowly to fruity licorice and plain chocolate.",
"Loch Lomond 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch whisky distilleries, Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar & Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla, situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, Including the UK, U.S., and Canada.
Richer and more complex than its younger sibling, with waxy peel, glacé cherries, sherry, sultanas, and custard. Silky smooth in the mouth, with marshmallows, milk chocolate, medium-sweet sherry, and stem ginger. Tingling spices allied to darkening chocolate and a touch of smoke in the medium to long finish. Finally, a fat, buttery note.",
"Black Bull 21 year old, 50%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Up close, this displays more sherry and dried fruits, particularly raisins, currants, and sultanas, with a deep strawberry note and dollop of marmalade. Quite pungent, and that resonates rewardingly at the back of the throat. The juicy mandarin flavor has some tartness, but then there’s cake mix, gingersnaps, clove, and toasted spices, though it gravitates back to the marmalade. The finish has dry, bitter orange, ginger, and spice, with a hint of lime zest. Confident and characterful.",
"Glen Moray 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"Every month seems to bring a new Octomore. Much is made of the peatiness of the malt used, but just as important is the way in which it is distilled and matured. It is these two aspects that give it sweetness and balance. This is minty, honey-sweet, with meadowsweet, some dried lavender, tinned peaches, and that hot sand note typical of Bruichladdich. The smoke is merely suggestive, giving an integrated power. 5 years old? Who knows what might happen next?",
"Ardbeg Kelpie, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,119,101 to 500 Dollars,"The maturation regime of this Clynelish involves first-fill American oak barrels, rejuvenated and refill American oak hogsheads, plus bodega and refill European oak butts. The minimum age in the assemblage is 15 years, and 2,946 bottles are available.  A complex, perfumed nose, with scorched grass, developing vanilla fudge, and freshly-peeled orange. Classic Clynelish waxiness on the palate, with toffee, more orange, peach, digestive biscuits, cinnamon, and developing pepper. The lengthy, creamy finish features chocolate-coated orange candy and ginger.",
"anCnoc Flaughter, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Following on from its limited edition 21 year old release, Dalmore has introduced a 30 year old expression, with 888 numbered bottles being available. Matured in a mix of Matusalem oloroso and Amoroso oloroso sherry butts sourced from the Gonzales Byass bodega. The nose is slightly meaty, with coffee, sherry, and stewed apple. Supple on the palate, with dark, spicy orange, black currant cordial, and marzipan. Spicy tannins kick in during the very long, fruity, finally mouth-drying finish.",
"Tobermory 21 year old, 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"A polished nose of red apple, cinnamon, caramels, and salted almonds makes for an enticing prospect on this showpiece dram. The taste exemplifies smoothness. The indulgent palate comprises dark cooked fruits, coffee, malty cocoa, sticky toffee pudding, fudge, and a fine line of orange. Roll it around the mouth: the integrated aged grains enable these select malts to achieve their full flavor potential. An exceptionally long finish has remnants of that toffee pudding and a well-sucked aniseed ball. Treat yourself.",
"Bladnoch Talia 25 year old, 49.2%",Single Malt Scotch,88,385,101 to 500 Dollars,"Another example of the old ‘Strathspey’ style of whisky, which predates the lighter, more estery/floral style we have become accustomed to. Here, distillery weight and time work in tandem to give a nose that has slightly overripe orchard fruits, smoke, and Seville orange. The palate then heads into the hedgerows—hawthorn and currant jam—before a waxiness emerges. The finish reveals a mix of smoke and mint. All in all, an excellent dram. £425",
"Classic Cask 23 year old Caribbean Rum Barrels, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Light in color it may be, but this is no wimp. The nose goes straight to the shore with mineral and salt, but it’s also sweet, which allows it to be fresh, lively, yet balanced. The palate delivers some menthol, bay laurel, more brininess, a hint of malt, and Parma violet. Everything remains very breezy, with peat smoke being blown from a kiln into salt-laden air. I prefer it to the 12 year old and the price is fantastic.",
"Duncan Taylor 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,25,0 to 100 Dollars,"Baked almond desserts liberally splashed with cream, light caramel, malted milk, and an invading cloud of smoke from newly ignited twigs: a lucky strike from a forest survivalist. On the palate, it is soft and blushing, with marmalade and warm butter, ground ginger, moving to chocolate orange, toffee, and Ovaltine. A whirl of spices and chunky chocolate round off this blend’s finish stylishly. This has all the hallmarks of a perfect nightcap.",
"Exclusive Malts (distilled at Glen Moray) 9 year old, 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"Dried peat smoke, a papery column of cigar ash, sizzling bacon fat, baked earth, and a shower of sea spray, coupled with hints of fresh peach and ripe fruits. The palate has a light, oily consistency ingrained with smokiness throughout, tasting of vanilla toffee, pick ‘n’ mix foam bananas, tangy citrus, and sweet tropical fruits, the whole arrangement given a peppery lift before succumbing to a late nuttiness. It’s not named after the Gaelic for smoky for nothing, you know.",
"Exclusive Malts (distilled at Clynelish) 21 year old, 52.5%",Single Malt Scotch,88,265,101 to 500 Dollars,"A single oloroso cask bottling, so an interesting comparison with the Loch Gorm (see below). The cask has more of an influence here, with plummy fruits, fig rolls, and Medjool dates. The smoke is restrained and foggy, allowing some seashore breezes to come through. The palate reverses this, with the smoke rolling in first, then the soft dark and sweet fruits, treacle, and garam masala. Tannins are very soft. Kilchoman with heft. (637 bottles) £90",
"Jura 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"Tarlogan is the third and most recent release in Glenmorangie’s Legends Collection. Some of the component whisky had been matured in virgin oak casks, while the remainder was aged in bourbon barrels.

Almonds and vanilla in the mildly spicy finish. (Travel Retail exclusive)",
"The Balvenie Peat Week 14 year old (2002 Vintage), 48.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,99,0 to 100 Dollars,"This limited edition 16 year old release is named after a collie dog that belonged to a distillery manager pictured in a 1905 photograph of Glenturret staff. Malt and milk chocolate, dried apricots, and subtle spice on the floral nose, with a hint of worn leather and, ultimately, ripe pears. Supple and rounded on the palate, with sweet spices, honey, black pepper, dark fruit, and coffee notes. Finally, bitter orange and plain chocolate in the medium-length finish. (1,740 bottles) £95",
"Convalmore 32 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 48.2%",Single Malt Scotch,88,1400,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"This expression was distilled during Arran’s second year of operation in September 1996 and bottled at 19 years of age.

Full on the palate, with juicy fruit, more malt and honey, and developing milk chocolate. Long and soft in the finish; lightly spiced, finally slightly citric, with a hint of brine and dry oak. £80",
"The Antiquary 21 year old, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"This portwood finish from Tomatin was matured for some 13 years in bourbon casks before being transferred for a final period of aging in Portuguese tawny port pipes, which had matured port for between 30 and 40 years. Initially reticent on the nose, with soft fruit notes, honey, and toffee, turning to cherry cough lozenges. Gently spiced on the nutty palate, with peaches and Cherryade. The finish is medium in length and always fruity.",
"Carlyle, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,13,0 to 100 Dollars,"A dense, suffocating fog of peat smoke, sea salt, dry seaweed on the high tide, and lemon-scented candles. Remember to come up for air once in a while. A supple, silky texture of lemon mousse, baked apple, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, and a massive rush of pepper. Hold this in your mouth for as long as possible; the flavor delivery is impressively long and constantly evolving. Hot, drying finish, and, frankly, a relief from the peppery assault on the palate. £47",
" Big Peat Christmas Edition 2017, 54.1%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"The style and class of the youngest was inspired by the classic elegance of Paris in the 1920s. Comprising Kininvie and Girvan married in tuns of Portuguese oak, this is pure, creamy goodness bathing in lemon meringue pie, vanilla tablet, and fresh oak shavings. A buttery-soft texture, the back of the palate kicks off with honey explosions, nougat, and toffee, backed with a distinct oakiness to remind you that it’s got much more to offer than just vanilla playfulness. £50 Travel Retail exclusive",
"J. Mossman Gold Crown 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,43,0 to 100 Dollars,"After six ‘Work in Progress’ releases, Kilkerran from Glengyle Distillery has finally come of age with this core expression.

"Chapter 7 2008 (distilled at Allt-a-Bhainne) 9 year old, 60.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"As the name implies, this non-chill filtered expression was finished in Pedro Ximinez sherry butts.

More spicy toffee, plus drying oak in the medium-length finish.",
"Chapter 7 2008 (distilled at Aultmore) 9 year old, 62.2%",Single Malt Scotch,88,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Lush and fruity. Sappy, with waxed fruit, golden raisin, plum, and nectarine rock candy. Mouth-clinging finish. Definitely post-prandial, after a hearty meal. (With a cigar, perhaps?) (Loch & K(e)y retailer exclusive)",
"Bunnahabhain Pedro Ximénez Cask Finish 15 year old, 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,99,0 to 100 Dollars,"Heavily peated Bunnahabhain spirit, referred to as Margadale, was used for this bottling and matured in refill sherry butts.

The nose offers icing sugar and soft toffee, vanilla, clementine, and wood varnish. More icing sugar, with orange and fudge on the palate, plus wood spice and an herbal note. Fruity through the finish, while spice builds, with a hint of aniseed at the close. An interesting alternative to the classic sherry-rich GlenDronach style.",
"Bunnahabhain Cruach-Mhóna, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,86,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"A rare bottling from a distillery that is more commonly released as a part of whisky blends. Light fruit and sweet malt define the nose, with apple, apricot, and honey. The entry is bursting with flavor, centered around malt, along with honey, salt, and apricot. The mid-palate adds a touch of oak, smoke, and spice, and is extremely well integrated and balanced. A medium-length finish ends abruptly and a little too dry, the only left turn in an otherwise superb whisky. (Julio’s Liquors only)",
"Johnnie Walker Black Label The Director’s Cut, 49%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Thick orange peels, grapefruit, lime zest, and Starburst taffy candies keep the nose of this premium expression within the purview of the Black Bull character. Layers of vanilla custard, mellow fruit, and ginger snaps quench an initial rush of sharp citrus. Sponge cake creaminess abounds though the spices nibble at the edges, leaving a long, sweet, citrus finish. Water nips the more acidic elements while leaving the citrus flavors intact.",
"Moon Harbour Pier #2 Peated Edition, 47.1%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured in bourbon casks, this expression offers a sweet, pleasing nose of honey, icing sugar, toffee bonbons, and orange peel. Medium-bodied, with barley sugar, soft oak, nectarine, and lychee. Vanilla and a return of honey in the medium-length finish.",
"Aberlour 16 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"A proportion of the component whiskies has been matured in virgin Black Sea oak casks, while the rest has been aged in bourbon barrels. The nose is sweet, with warm cloves and soft peat; a hint of brine. When it comes to the palate—curious! Menthol and herbal notes, toasted oak, plain chocolate, sweet antiseptic. Mildly tannic in the finish, with subtle peaty spiciness. An herbal peat note lingers long.",
"The Macallan Classic Cut (2017 Edition), 58.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,89,0 to 100 Dollars,"Peated to 14.8 ppm, this expression from anCnoc’s Peaty Collection falls between Rutter and Cutter in terms of its phenolic level.

Finishing occurred in manzanilla sherry casks. Orange marmalade, nutmeg, and developing vanilla on the nose. Full bodied, with a palate of citrus fruit and soft spices, aniseed, and developing tannins. Lingering in the finish, with spicy plain chocolate. Ultimately, the tannins fade and leave a fresh citric note.",

Talia has been finished in new American oak casks. Sweet and floral on the nose, with violets, Jaffa orange, and fragrant fresh oak. Medium to full-bodied, with rich fruit notes, praline, malt, and finally, raisins and prunes. Dark oak in the long, mouth-drying finish.",
"Old Pulteney 25 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,600,501 to 1000 Dollars,"I’m reminded of leafy ferns in spring, sweet melon, green bananas, fresh cream, and a dusting of spice when I nose this blend. A light, green fruit taste of white grape and melon overlaid with runny toffee and banana, before the impression of thick fruit skins, becoming slightly tannic. Light spices and pepper follow with a finish of apple core and rich spice. (760 bottles)",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky No.1 35 year old, 46.5%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"When in doubt, the answer to any question is usually ‘more whisky.’ Here, peat smoke takes an upper hand over the sweet aromas of juicy orange and pear. The whisky begins icing-sugar sweet, settles to bubble gum, pear, apple, and malt, showing its impeccably balanced, finely textured character replete with strands of oak spices, gentle smoke, baked pastry, and vanilla custard. You can’t go wrong at this price.",
"Berrys’ Islay Reserve, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,63,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distilled in September 2007 and matured in a first-fill bourbon barrel (#5315), this is a fine example of how good a relatively youthful Speyside malt can be, given the right cask.

"Benriach The Original Ten, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,54,0 to 100 Dollars,"Relatively dry on the nose, with citrus fruit, hazelnut, and quite dry sherry.

"Cardhu 11 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2020), 56%",Single Malt Scotch,88,111,101 to 500 Dollars,"The nose is floral, with honey, toffee, cereal, and a hint of smoke, but subtle maritime notes are also present. The palate is rich and relatively complex: spicy, with citrus fruit, more cereal, seaweed, peat smoke, and oak. Lengthy in the finish, with toffee, new leather, and perpetual spice. A long-standing favorite with a very distinctive profile.",
"DS Tayman 12 year old Flam Wine Barrel-Finished (Distilled at Linkwood; Cask No. 180803325), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Lemon juice, tide pools, roasted pork, and peat embers mingle on the nose. Smoky toffee in time. Canned peach slices in syrup over woodsmoke on the palate; buttery smoked fish, lots of energetic spices. The finish is fruity, with aniseed and lingering spices.",
"Gordon & MacPhail 125th Anniversary 1984 (Distilled at Glenury Royal; Cask No. 2335), 49.1%",Single Malt Scotch,88,2500,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"An upfront classic single malt from an undisclosed Islay distillery, launched to coincide with the opening of Hunter Laing’s Ardnahoe Distillery.

Bold tropical fruits on the palate, with toffee, red berries, and more soft woodsmoke. The medium-length finish highlights licorice and drying oak.",
"DS Tayman 10 year old Flam Wine Barrel-Finished (Distilled at Caol Ila), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. A whiff of brine on the early nose, with damp earth, citrus fruit, cereal, and mildly smoky oak. The palate is supple and offers vanilla toffee, cedarwood, hazelnuts, and more brine. A spicy finish yields coconut and a hint of dry peat.",
"Bruichladdich Octomore 11.1, 59.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Sherbet, creamy vanilla, whole lemon, fresh baked goods, sweet grain notes, strong floral blooms, with hints of snuff and ground pepper on the nose. Light, delicate palate of lemon flesh; the citrus sharpens up, with grapefruit flavors supported by fine ground pepper and a lasting wave of vanilla. A pleasing tingle of spices on the finish, coupled with punchy citrus notes. A nimble, vigorous blend that offers a multitude of serves. Best Values",
"Bladnoch 10 year old, 46.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Made from the same recipe as previous Peat Week bottlings, with the name referring to the one week per year Balvenie distills peated whisky.

The fruits darken in the finish, with licorice and spicy oak. (18,000 bottles)",
"Chivas, 25 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"A rich, fruity nose of baked apple, fruitcake, sliced almond, honey, and white pepper. At cask strength this is quite a bumpy ride, with warm apple, sultana, and caramel revving up to a jagged peak of ginger, pepper, and clove. When your taste buds emerge on the other side, it settles into a more pleasing caramel and toffee sweetness. Perfect for armchair mountaineers.",
"Johnnie Walker Gold, 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Lime syrup, grapefruit peel, Smarties candy, ripe peach, and orange peel zested over vanilla frosting make for an attractive nose. Fruity and tangy with green apple, lemon, vanilla, burnt oak, clove, and pepper, developing more candy sweetness than fruit flavors in the latter phases. As the spiciness blooms, extra layers of vanilla and toffee are added. A tangy fruit finish with a citrus edge.",
Cask & Thistle 29 year old 1974 Vintage (distilled at Aberfeldy),Single Malt Scotch,87,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"A period of finishing in a combination of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry puncheons and hogsheads distinguishes this release.

"Signatory (distilled at Ben Nevis), Cask #7438, 31 year old, 1975 vintage, 58.4%",Single Malt Scotch,87,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"This Glenkinchie malt and Cameronbridge grain blend highlights the vanilla character of Black Label with a nose of green apple, dry grasses, vanilla toffee, peach pit, and banana custard, with subtle hints of oak and spice. The mouthfeel is light with green apple and candied lemon, growing fruitier with boiled candies and a hint of creaminess, all held in check by the spice. Grassy finish with a hefty backdraft of spice.",
"Wild Scotsman (distilled at Ben Nevis), 13 year old, 1992 vintage, cask #693",Single Malt Scotch,87,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"This strikes an earnest tone with a nose of rich fruit, dried apricot, whole orange, macadamia nut, ground spices, and pepper crackers. A blend of 21 malts, and the first blended malt in Royal Salute’s 66-year history, this has a harmonious palate comprising citrus, apple, pear, barley sugar, and ginger spice, with a finish focused on orange and a little spice.",
"BenRiach 12 year old 1994 vintage, 56%",Single Malt Scotch,87,66,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distilled in 2013 from Scottish barley, this 107 ppm 5 year old was matured entirely in first-fill American oak casks. Quite elemental on the nose, with brine, rock pool, and cigarette ash aromas, plus ginger and an ultimate hint of nougat. Peaches on the palate, with lively spices, roasted nuts, oak, and dark peat. The finish features licorice, overt peat, and black pepper. (42,000 bottles)",
"BenRiach 20 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"The youngest Octomore released to date, 10.4 was distilled from Scottish barley peated to 88 ppm, then aged for 3 years in 28 highly toasted virgin Limousin French oak casks.

The finish yields dried fruits, bitter oak, and hot spices. (12,000 bottles)",
"Bw3 Elements of Islay (distilled at Bowmore), 51.6%",Single Malt Scotch,85,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Light amber. A very clean, mealy, and creamy nose with real sweetness and a belt of vanilla before things settle into the realm of cooked fruits enlivened by masses of peppermint. The oak shows itself as hot sawdust and a little cedar. In the mouth, that sweetness continues to alternate between a prickly feel and sweet fruit syrups, while Macallan’s oily earthiness anchors it both on the tongue and to the distillery. 285 bottles.",
"Signatory 16 year old 1988 vintage (Cask #42508, distilled at Bowmore), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"The first peated expression from Glnglassaugh after reopening in 2008, Torfa is made from barley malted to 20 ppm and matured in bourbon barrels. Bonfire smoke, ozone, orchard fruits, malt, and black pepper are present on the nose. Slightly savory on the smooth palate, with sweet peat smoke, honey, dark chocolate, and a very mild maritime note. Ginger, apricot, and more sweet peat in the finish.",
"Bruichladdich Infinity, 55.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"This latest release comprises the contents of nine first-fill European sherry-seasoned oak hogsheads, eight bourbon barrels, and nine refill casks, all laid down in 1998.

"Murray McDavid (distilled at Bruichladdich) 1986, 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Unlike the Jane Walker package for Johnnie Walker Black Label released in 2018, this is a new whisky altogether, a blend of various malts aged at least 10 years, including Cardhu and Clynelish. The nose is floral and gently nutty, with rose water, salted almonds, green apple, nougat, and caramel chews. Light-bodied and silky in the mouth, it has bright flavors of lime, lemon, vanilla, and coconut, before edging into nutty milk chocolate and finishing with good length, and a final savory note. Best Value",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Caol Ila), 8 year old, 1996 vintage, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,87,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"A bit reticent on the nose, with light aromas of jasmine, freesia, coconut, vanilla, and hints of kiwi, pineapple, and strawberry. The palate is oily and highlights more coconut, pineapple, vanilla, and strawberry, plus lemon, sandalwood, and mingled spices. On the finish, crushed nuts top a chocolate and vanilla malted milkshake, and lengthy oak caps things off. (156 bottles; U.S. exclusive)",
"Clynelish, 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"Rose blossom, vanilla, and cocoa powder to start, while sultana, walnut, and oloroso notes develop in time on the nose. Soft on the palate, with tingling spices, malt extract, cake mix, raisins, dates, figs, and dark chocolate, all set against relatively dry oak. Dates, prunes, and spicy dark chocolate in the lingering finish.",
"Cragganmore Distillers Edition, 1992 vintage, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"As with most of the Tomintoul range, the nose is quiet, with diluted orange juice and fondant cream in time. The fruity palate majors in canned peaches in cream, with encroaching nuttiness and white pepper. Fruit remains a feature in the medium-length finish, with cocoa and malt.",
"Dalwhinnie, 29 year old, 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"Strong brine on the early nose, with subtle peat, red berry fruits, and a beach barbecue. On the palate, raspberries smoked over a peat fire, then served with cream, plus a slight meatiness. Citrus fruit, char, white pepper, and cocoa powder in the finish.",
"Blackadder Raw Cask (distilled at Edradour), 1976, 49.4%",Single Malt Scotch,87,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"Like its 15 year old sibling, this was matured in bourbon casks before being finished in first-fill European oak butts. The spicy nose yields toffee, sherry, and poached pears. The palate is supple, spicy, and slightly herbal, with dried fruits, then big caramel, vanilla, and orange notes develop. The finish is quite dry and earthy, with oak and a hint of chile.",
"Scott Selection (distilled at Glen Grant) 1973, 26 year old, 58.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,98,0 to 100 Dollars,"The nose yields orange and lime, canned pineapple, and light caramel notes. Elegant, with some substance on the palate, with vanilla and brittle toffee underpinned by vibrant orchard fruits, honey, and milk chocolate. The finish features more milk chocolate, gentle oak, and ginger. Best Value",
"Murray McDavid Mission IV (distilled at Glen Spey), 1974 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,210,101 to 500 Dollars,"Apricots and candle wax aromas on the early nose, with honey, caramel, and a hint of
cinnamon. Supple on the palate, with juicy peaches, ripe banana, malt, licorice, and
wood spices. The finish is long, with aniseed, spicy oak, dark chocolate, and black
pepper. (1,468 bottles) £65",
"Glendronach 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,48,0 to 100 Dollars,"A 2020 addition to the Fettercairn stable, this expression was distilled using chocolate
malt, and matured in first-fill bourbon casks before a finishing in sherry and port
casks. The nose is slightly meaty, with raisins, black treacle, white pepper, and dark
chocolate. Smooth on the substantial palate, with drinking chocolate, plums, black
pepper, cinnamon, and a savory note. Ginger, chile, instant coffee, and pipe tobacco
in the finish. £70",
"Glengoyne 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Warm machine oil on the early nose, slightly herbal, with apricots and vanilla
emerging in time. Slick on the palate, with light smoke, honey, delicate spices, and
eventually, burnt toffee. The finish features licorice, pipe tobacco, and white pepper.
Ultimately mouth-drying. £170",
"Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1967, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"This unpeated single malt updates and replaces the previous 10 year old. It presents tropical fruits, vanilla, honey, and ginger on the nose. Soft fruits, malt, and milk chocolate inhabit the creamy, well-balanced palate. Hazelnuts, drinking chocolate, and light spices surface in the medium-length finish, with just a wisp of smoke.",
"Glenlivet French Oak Reserve 15 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"The nose is lightly floral, with pears and ripe peaches, followed by red apple with a light sprinkling of white pepper. The palate is creamy and very sweet, with more orchard fruits and a little spice. The medium-length finish is slightly drying, with some lightly spiced oak

 ",
"Glenmorangie 1977 Vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Kosher-certified and matured in a refill bourbon barrel, before finishing in a barrel from Israel’s Flam Winery. Sweet red wine, strawberries and cream, and spicy apple pie on the nose. The palate is voluptuous, with cocoa, Brazil nuts, and increasingly dry red wine. Dark-chocolate raspberry liqueur, oak, and black pepper in the long finish. (1,600 bottles)",
"The Glenrothes, 1989, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,56,0 to 100 Dollars,"Royal Glenury was established in 1825 and closed in 1985. Salted butter on the early nose, Turkish delight, then dry nutty sherry. Very nutty on the palate, with figs and wine tannins. The lengthy finish reveals dates, bitter coffee, and black treacle. (397 bottles, 38 for U.S.)",
"Duncan Taylor 'Rarest of the Rare' (distilled at Glenugie), Cask #5156, 22 year old, 1975 vintage, 58.0%",Single Malt Scotch,87,215,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is the first release of Singleton of Dufftown to be matured solely in refill American oak hogsheads. The nose is slightly earthy, with developing barley sugar and green fruits. The supple palate offers honey, sweet orange, walnuts, and soft spice. The finish is peppery, with crystallized ginger and a hint of dark chocolate.",
"Highland Park 1990 vintage 15 year old (Cask #10146), 53.6%",Single Malt Scotch,87,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"This kosher-certified single cask was matured in a refill bourbon barrel before finishing in a wine barrel from Israel’s Flam Winery. The nose opens with barbecue smoke and new leather, then rosé wine, salt, and ginger cookies emerge. The nutty palate features woodsmoke, cocoa, instant coffee, stewed fruits, and more salt. The finish is long, with coffee, dry red wine, and prickly oak. (400 bottles)",
"Murray McDavid (distilled at Highland Park) 1988 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,48,0 to 100 Dollars,"Made with barley malted to 139.6 ppm, distilled in 2014, and matured 5 years in first-fill Jim Beam, Jack Daniel, and Heaven Hill casks. Citrus fruit and unripe bananas on the nose, and in time, clean pine notes. Vanilla, salted caramel, chewy orange, and prickly woodsmoke on the palate. Lively, prickly, prominent peat, a suggestion of honey, and more citrus fruit in the lengthy finish. (30,000 bottles)",
"Auchentoshan Cooper’s Reserve 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Hard not to compare this to the 12 year old, as they are of similar strength and character. This is more about the peat bank rather than the shore, more eucalyptus than kelp. This pungent, earthy note is retained with water, alongside some brine. The palate is like carrageen moss pudding, with a touch of nutmeg at the end. Plenty there, but it all moves very quickly when I want it to linger. That said, a solid performer. £47/500 ml",
"The Macallan 1951 Vintage, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,2000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Chivas's new entry into the premium blend category. A complex whisky (on the nose and palate) in the same vein as Chivas 18, only deeper, with more caramelized sweetness, darker fruit, and greater emphasis on dried spices and roasted nuts (and perhaps even tobacco). Everything moves along nicely -- and entertainingly -- until the whisky approaches the finish on the palate. Its age begins to show, as spicy oak dryness and suggestions of polished leather begin to dominate through to the finish. An enjoyable whisky, but I prefer the 18 year old to the 25 year old for its impeccable balance.",
"Scott's Selection (distilled at Mortlach) 1961, 39 year old, 40.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,175,101 to 500 Dollars,"An example that older, more expensive isn’t always better, this 18 year old gem is as good as many blends twice its price. The foundation of Johnnie Walker Gold is delicate, clean, and honeyed, along with a fresh sea character (from Clynelish?) that provides a youthful zing. Notes of vanilla, shortbread, tropical fruit, freshly cut hay, marshmallow, and even a hit of peat, round out the palate. Its finish is subtly complex and nicely balanced. The blend has improved nicely over the past several years. 
",
"Old Pulteney 17 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"A prime component in Dewar’s blended scotch. The finer bottles of Aberfeldy are quite flavorful, yet still maintain a degree of elegance and finesse. This bottling is an excellent example of this. Its dominant flavor note is fruit (orange, honeydew melon), with some creamy vanilla notes, caramel, and light toffee. Subtle spice notes and a hint of peat tease the palate. The extra aging adds depth to the whisky, yet this whisky remains quite clean and fresh on the palate. Subtly spicy, gently dry finish. Nicely done! (Exclusive to Binny’s Beverage Depot, Chicago, IL.)",
"Signatory (distilled at Rosebank), 14 year old, 1991 vintage, cask #4755, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Very traditional West Highland style: somewhat rustic, muscular, and oily in texture, with notes of leather, bourbon, espresso, orange peel, kiwi, and a suggestion of ultra-aged Caribbean rum. Occasionally, a softer side of vanilla and coconut shows itself, but, if this whiskey were a man, he would be a lumberjack. 
",
"Springbank 40 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,950,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Very robust and chewy-this whisky has plenty of gusto-with notes of toffee, vanilla cream, bitter chocolate, powdered cocoa, and almond fig cake. Background citrus (especially on the nose), tobacco, and polished leather. Nice depth for such a young whisky, and very exciting. 
",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Tamnavulin), 37 year old, 1967 vintage, 46.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,240,101 to 500 Dollars,"Leafy bonfire smoke, damp kiln, tar, anise, dark chocolate, and a hint of clove. All this is balanced by an underlying malty foundation and a kiss of honey, vanilla, and tropical fruit. Nice to see single cask, cask strength bottlings of peated BenRiach. (Exclusive to The Party Source)",
"Tobermory 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,36,0 to 100 Dollars,"The most richly textured and complex of the unpeated expressions. Base notes of honeyed malt and creamy vanilla are complemented by citrus fruit (lemon, tangerine), coconut, bitter chocolate, exotic wood shavings, and a hint of assorted nuts. Polished oak finish.",
"Bruichladdich PC6, 61.6%",Single Malt Scotch,87,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"Matured in a port pipe. The third in a trilogy (the other two being bourbon and sherry cask-aged). I like this one better than the sherry cask 1990 vintage, but not quite as much as the bourbon cask bottling which was in our Top Ten whiskies two years ago. Lovely amber ruby color. The port flavors are obvious, but not sappy or dominating. They’re clean, and contribute a layered sweetness and ripe red berry fruit notes to the traditional, moderately peated Bowmore smoke and peat. Lingering smoke and chocolate on the finish. 
",
"Tomatin, 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Medium-bodied and nicely textured. Good balance of flavors -- and well-integrated, too -- with lovely sweet notes (cereal grain, cookie dough, caramel, and vanilla cream), young heathery peat, tar, fishnets, and brine that is complementary, but not aggressive, with a suggestion of lavender and tangerine. Balanced finish. (332 bottles produced.)",
"Tomatin, 30 year old, 1976 vintage, 49.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,400,101 to 500 Dollars,"Aged in a sherry cask, and the sherry is clean and bright. I’m also picking up a good dose of warming peat smoke, along with molasses, and a gentle maltiness throughout. A peppering of subtle brine and a hint of seaweed peak through occasionally, reminding one of its Islay roots.",
"Auchentoshan Blood Oak, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Also distilled in 2009, this is mid-gold in color and medium weight, with a mass of sage-like smoke. More cask influence than 7.1, with smoked coconut, and again a mix of sweet fruits and lemon behind this smoky lead. Oily and rich, but a little fragmented on the tongue; the elements are beginning to cohere to produce integrated complexity. Octomore in mellow mood, with smoked chestnut and a little farmyardy Pinot note. Another positive work in progress report. £125",
"The Antiquary, 1977 vintage, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"The Islay character is most evident in the younger whisky expressions, before the oak has tamed them. This whisky is a perfect example: an uninhibited, incredibly powerful Caol Ila, thumping out notes of tarry rope, damp peat, kippers, and seaweed. Background spices (salt, pepper, ginger) add intrigue, while a firm foundation of vanilla malt struggles to provide soothing comfort. Extreme Islay whisky. (A Binny’s Beverage Depot exclusive.) 
",
"John MacDougall's Selection (distilled at Bladnoch), 16 year old, 55.8%,",Single Malt Scotch,87,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"It’s good to see an official distillery bottling of Clynelish in the U.S. This one is very true to the Clynelish style: fresh, appetizing, and very drinkable. Notes of brine, fruit (lemon-lime), and vanilla-accented malt, are the foundation of this whisky. Delicate seaweed, peat, exotic pepper and a hint of citrus rind bitterness entertain the palate throughout, all the way to its appetizingly briny, seaweed-tinged finish. Perhaps the definitive aperitif whisky. 
",
"Linkwood, 1996 vintage, 58.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,325,101 to 500 Dollars,"Matured in port casks. The standard Cragganmore 12 year old is one of Scotland’s best kept secrets-I enjoy its incredibly complex, dry, spicy character. The port contributes ripe fruit flavors (cherries in syrup, golden raisins, mandarin, glazed berries) which complements the dry spicy notes nicely and makes for a more balanced product. Still, for this, the whisky sacrifices some of its individuality and brilliancy with all that port. A fair trade-off, though. 
",
"Glen Elgin, 1998 vintage, 61.1%",Single Malt Scotch,87,406,101 to 500 Dollars,"Style: Highland single malt scotch Color: Gold Aroma: Quite fruity (especially apples). Hint of honey and caramel with subtle background oak. Prickling alcohol before the addition of water. Palate: Smooth and mouth-coating. Nicely balanced. Delicately honeyed fruit notes up from, followed by oak and toffee, becoming dry and spicy with pleasant lingering oak. 
",
"Royal Lochnagar 'Selected Reserve,' 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,210,101 to 500 Dollars,"Gold color. Aromas of toffee, nuts, and a hint of mint. Medium in body, with a malty, coating texture. The flavors evolve on the palate, with toffee up front, malty sweetness in the middle and nutty, finishing pleasantly dry with a hint of mint and vanilla. 
",
"Arran The Peacock 1996 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,62,0 to 100 Dollars,"Amber chestnut color. Aromas are rich and express great depth, with highlights of ripe fruit and wood spices. Well-rounded flavors are balanced very nicely, with a gentle sweetness up front that marries well with ripe fruit, becoming dry with background wood spice notes. 
",
"Edradour Caledonia, 12 year old, 46%, ",Single Malt Scotch,87,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Although this distillery is operating, it remains one of the hardest Speyside whiskies to find. This is unfortunate. A fairly straight-forward whisky-pleasingly malty and somewhat viscous on the palate, with some grassy notes. The extra years, with this particular bottling anyway, have allowed the whisky to blossom, become a little more intriguing and heavier. Along with malt and grassy notes, I’m picking up citrus fruit (especially on the nose), toffee, nuts, freshly ground roasted cocoa beans, nougat, and vanilla fudge. 
",
"Signatory (distilled at Glen Ord), 1998 Vintage, 11 year old, Cask #3465, 60.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"Over the past decade there has been no shortage of Glendronach expressions. I know of at least one 15 year old, an 18 year old, a 19 year old, a 1968 vintage, and four different 12 year old versions. My favorite of the range was the limited edition 19 year old released here in the U.S. about a decade ago. The 1968 Vintage, which you can still find on retailers’ shelves, is also a worthy dram. But this new 12 year old “Original” expression is certainly my favorite of the 12s (and the 15). I feel that Glendronach expresses itself best when it is not dominated by the sherry, allowing a greater balance of flavors. This whisky was originally matured in sherry casks, but was then (fortunately) aged in bourbon casks for the remainder of its maturation. The result? A richly flavored, nicely balanced whisky expressing notes of sherried fruit, burnt caramel, light toffee, and nuts, all underpinned by a soothing malty foundation. Yum! 
",
"Glenrothes, 1994 Vintage, $43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"While younger Glengoyne whiskies are enjoyable but often fairly straight-forward in flavor, the older expressions develop nicely in depth. Regardless of age, there’s always a creamy maltiness as the foundation of the whisky. For this expression, notes of honey, cookie dough, dry spice notes (vanilla, cinnamon) and soft fruit (citrus, apple) round out the palate. This whisky is clean, polished, and very drinkable. A new addition to the Glengoyne line, and very welcome.",
"Duncan Taylor NC2 (distilled at Glen Scotia) 1981 vintage 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,114,101 to 500 Dollars,"Deep gold color. A very delightful aroma that defies its age, with notes of rich creamy vanilla, exotic tropical fruit, honey, and toasted oak. Rich, mouth coating texture and body. Its flavor starts out like its aroma-creamy vanilla, tropical fruit, honey-then turns dry and becomes very dry, leathery, and oaky on the finish. Soothing, long dry finish.",
"Eades “Double Malt” Islay (Second Edition), 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"I enjoy Glenlivet whisky for its subtle elegance, floral notes, along with a delicious ""peaches & cream"" flavor. For this particular whisky, finishing some of the whisky in new French oak barrels adds depth, dried spice (vanilla, clove) and pleasing dryness to the Glenlivet profile. This whisky is more polished and refined than the 12 year old expression it replaces.",
"GlenDronach Sauternes Finish 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Style: Highland single malt scotch Color: Gold Aroma: Subtly complex and somewhat dry, with notes of vanilla, almonds, hay, freshly cut grass, and a hint of smoke. Palate: Clean and malty up front, becoming dry as it begins to reveal its age, as the maltiness turns into a potpourri of spice and dried fruit. Dry on the finish and spicy-almost peppery. Its finish is big and long for a Glenmorangie whisky.",
"Kilchoman, Winter 2010 Release, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,63,0 to 100 Dollars,"Amber gold color. Rich, honeyed malt in aroma. Quite floral, with subtle notes of dried fruit. Full, rich body. Very malty flavors, with notes of honeyed fruit up front, turning dry on the finish with notes of oak, vanilla, and dried fruit.

"Gordon & MacPhail “Private Collection” Madeira Wood Finish (distilled at Caol Ila), 1998 Vintage, 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"The only sherry cask-aged Rarest of the Rare whisky reviewed here. Rich thick cut marmalade, combined with chewy toffee, sultana, and nuts. The oak adds spice, balance, and complexity. This isn’t a one-trick (sherry) pony. There’s a lot going on here. Spicy, resinous finish. One of the best Glenugies I have tasted. 
",
"Clynelish 1993, Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs’ Choice range, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"The darkest and most decadent of the three 15 year olds here. Notes of molasses, demerara rum, apricot, and dates. More subtle notes of mixed nuts, sap, tobacco, and fig, with just a hint of Moroccan spice and leather. Surprisingly complex for a whisky this young, and the most intriguing of the younger expressions reviewed here. (Bottled for Beltramo’s Fine Wines & Spirits)",
"The Dalmore Tay Dram, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,69,0 to 100 Dollars,"Deep gold color. Nicely balanced aroma of honeyed malt, fruit, floral notes, and a hint of the sea. Medium in body and smooth. The palate begins with soothing honey notes, followed by a rich maltiness. Ripe fruit flavors emerge, lush and delicious. The whisky eventually becomes dry and floral, with a suggestion of salt.",
"Auchentoshan 1977, 49.0%",Single Malt Scotch,87,607,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Amber copper color. Very mature aroma of oak, damp earth, peat smoke, licorice, soft citrus, and seaweed. Full-bodied and somewhat oily. A gently sweet vanilla note up front-albeit very briefly-then a quick flash of citrus fruit and seaweed. After that it's a battle between peat smoke and oak, with the oak ultimately winning. Very long, dry, smoky finish.",
Ardmore Traditional Cask 1998,Single Malt Scotch,87,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Amber mahogany color. Its 50 years of age are evident in the nose-there's plenty of resinous wood spice notes (especially clove). Also on the nose is citrus (especially orange), a potpourri of dried fruit, light toffee, and a hint of smoked nuts. The body is thick and viscous. The palate expresses flavors similar to its aroma, finishing dry and long.",
"Hazelburn 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Straw gold color. Very mature aromas of oak and citrus, with a hint of smoke, dry vanilla, floral and spice notes. Flavors are very mature and fairly dry throughout, mirroring the aroma’s dominant oaky vanilla notes, with citrus, and subtle smoke. Long, lingering finish. 
",
"Kilchoman Loch Gorm 2016 (distilled 2010), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Named in honor of the copper teapot from which distillery workers were ‘drammed’ until the 1970s, this distillery-exclusive bottling has been matured in first-fill oloroso sherry casks for an unspecified period. The nose is fruity and fragrant, with profound spicy sherry notes. Mouth-coating, with lots more sherry, plus prunes, drinking chocolate, and a little oak. Lingering in the finish, with drying sherry, light spice, and dark chocolate. A great dram for lovers of a true sherry monster! £60",
"Old Pulteney 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,35,0 to 100 Dollars,"Pleasingly sweet and fruity, with notes of caramel apples, berries in honey, vanilla, and ripe pear. Fresh brine and subtle mint emerge occasionally and linger on the finish. Nicely balanced, more complex with a wider range of flavors than the Old Pulteney 21 year old. ",
"Edradour 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Delicately floral (lavender, rose) and perfumed, with notes of chamomile, hay, soft vanilla and gentle malt. Creamy and soothing, with a gently dry finish. Lots of depth for a lighter weight whisky. A lovely aperitif. I feel Rosebank is freshest and best when it is young. With the distillery closing in 1993, now’s the time to act, and this is one of the better bottlings I’ve tasted. 
",
"Auchentoshan Bourbon Matured 1975, 46.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,750,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Antique gold color. Mature aromas of creamy vanilla, thick coconut, oak, and a hint of mint. The classic Springbank sea breeze aroma struggles for recognition. Medium body and oily in texture. Flavors deliver what the aroma promises, with additional dry wood spices and a very long finish.",
"Adelphi (distilled at Glen Grant) 1985 25 year old, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,87,138,101 to 500 Dollars,"Deep amber/chestnut/crimson color, suggesting a good dose of sherry cask aging, which the palate confirms. Syrupy notes of fruitcake, burnt fig, raisin, and beeswax are balanced by resinous oak, polished leather, roasted nuts, and dried spice on the finish. The 37 years of oak impact is balanced nicely by the sherry, even if both are a bit extreme for what is normally a more elegant dram. 
",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Old Pulteney) 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Straw gold. Aromas of a sweet shop-vanilla, honey, marshmallow, and confectioner’s sugar. Light to medium body, and soft. Clean flavors, which are very malty and honeyed, with notes of marshmallow and vanilla. Gently sweet finish.",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Bunnahabhain) Rare Auld Range 1987 vintage 24 year old, 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is six year old, 40 ppm phenol (very smoky) whisky distilled at Bruichladdich, bottled at cask strength and enhanced in Madeira casks. A young whisky, but mature enough to say that it’s not too young. The immediate impact is damp peat smoke and smoldering charcoal. If you are patient and observant enough (and with an addition of water), you’ll coax notes of vanilla, berried fruit, pear, green apple, and underlying spice (fresh mint, anise), all leading to a briny, smoldering smoke finish. A cult whisky for those who like to push the envelope. When compared to its predecessor, PC5, PC6 is slightly darker in color, creamier, fruitier, and a shade softer. Given this, I still prefer the PC5 over the PC6 for its clarity and innocence.",
"Talisker 175th Anniversary bottling, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"The scents of a forest floor—dried leaves, old pine needles, twigs—mingle with stewed fruit, biscuity malt, lemon oil, and rose petal soap. The palate is light and candy-sweet, like strawberry jelly beans, candied rose petals, and sugar cookies tinged with cinnamon. Youthful and very light, but pleasant. (Total Wine & More)",
"Glenglassaugh Aged Over 30 Years, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,637,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Bold and spicy, but with enough backbone to handle it. Surely the most intense of the bunch overall. (The 25 year old is dry on the palate -- especially on the finish -- but the 30 year old challenges you the throughout.) There’s plenty of oak here, imparting leather, resin, and dried spice notes (cinnamon, clove, vanilla), but it is rescued by sherried fruit, honeyed citrus, and toffee. A powerful dram.",
"Glenfarclas Family Cask 1981 (Cask #57), 50.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,386,101 to 500 Dollars,"The fresher of the two, with appetizing brine, honey, lemon rock candy, golden raisin, and peach. Subtle ginger, toasted marshmallow, and coconut round out the palate. Very bright and lively.",
"Glenfarclas Family Cask 1984 (Cask #6030), 51%",Single Malt Scotch,87,392,101 to 500 Dollars,"Deep on the nose and palate, with notes of dark rum, dried fruit, roasted nuts, dark chocolate, cinnamon, polished leather, charcoal, and a suggestion of peat.  Dry, resinous finish.  Bonus points for intrigue.
",
"Cragganmore 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Bright gold color, and bright in flavor. Very much in the Bladnoch style, with honey-kissed lemon, tangerine, kiwi, creamy vanilla, lightly toasted marshmallow, marzipan, cut grass, and hay. Richly textured for a Lowland, and palate-coating (a tad oily, too!). The extra years have added some depth, while still retaining a youthful zest. Very enjoyable.
",
"Dalwhinnie Distillers Edition 1992, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,81,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured in a sherry cask. Chock full of ripe fruit, but still quite feminine in personality. Firm malt foundation, almost buttery in texture, with juicy oak, maple syrup, raspberry (red and black), strawberry, and dates, peppered with gentle spice (cinnamon, ginger). While this is a very enjoyable whisky, I have tasted some excellent Linkwood bottlings, including the standard 12 year old from back in the early 1990s, that brandished less sherry, allowing more of Linkwood’s gentle nature to blossom. Still, the sherry influence here is pristine, and it gives as much as it masks. (430 bottles)£200",
"Chieftain’s (distilled at Glenturret) 21 year old, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"Matured in a “rejuvenated European oak” cask. Balance: that’s what I like best about this whisky. It’s not as individualistic or distinctive as the others, but that’s how I always think of Glen Elgin, so no surprise here. This is a solid effort: fruity and flowery, with notes of tangerine, marmalade, caramel apple, ginger, cut grass, cinnamon, almond paste, and underlying vanilla, lingering in a satisfying finish. (534 bottles) £250",
"Arran The Eagle 1999, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,66,0 to 100 Dollars,"So nice to see this whisky available here in the U.S. again. A more mature, more sherried expression of the standard Royal Lochnagar. Rich, silky, and sweet, with molasses, nutty toffee, old demerara pot still rum, caramelized fig, marmalade, and juicy oak. More subtle notes of honeyed ginger, coffee grounds, and tobacco leaf add complexity. A soothing post-prandial dram.",
"Glenrothes 1978, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,322,101 to 500 Dollars,"Complex, dynamic, and well-balanced. Honeyed vanilla, bright fruit (lemon, tangerine, nectarine), sultana, green grapes, and banana bread, peppered with ginger and subtle, gripping grape skin. Great mouth-feel (from the oak), which adds another dimension. That’s what 46% and no chill-filtering will do for a whisky. One of the better Arran whiskies I’ve tasted. (Released in 2009. Sadly not available in the U.S.) £38",
"The Macallan Diamond Jubilee, 52%",Single Malt Scotch,87,549,501 to 1000 Dollars,"A release chosen by Douglas Maclean (and named after his song “Caledonia”). Full sherry impact, but contained—not excessive or sappy. Rich, with nutty toffee, pot still rum, a variety of raisins (regular and golden), date, honeyed fruit, polished leather, and a hint of tobacco. Good resinous grip on the finish to balance the sweetness. The flavors are nicely integrated. ",
"Kilkerran Work in Progress 4 (2012 Release), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"Bright gold color. Big and firm on the palate. Quite fruity too (tangerine, pear, sultana, pineapple), on a dry malty foundation. Lighter notes of grass, hay, linseed oil, and dried vanilla add complexity. Dried fruit and malt finish. A really nice dram with gobs of character.",
"Wemyss “A Matter of Smoke” 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Very bright and lively, with a nice balance of flavors. Zesty fruit (lemon, peach, ripe pineapple, golden raisin) on a bed of layered sweetness (creamy vanilla, light honey, lightly toasted marshmallow, and a hint of coconut). Gently dry, delicately spicy, dried citrus finish. Light enough and with enough zing to enjoy before dinner, but it should stand up well enough after dinner, too. This is a nice whisky, but it shows a lighter, more elegant side of Glenrothes. It doesn’t express the rich, opulent notes often shown in bottlings like the 1972 Vintage, for example.",
"Talisker 30 year old, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,471,101 to 500 Dollars,"Glen Scotia has always been the bridesmaid to Springbank. This is justifiable, considering that both production and availability of quality bottlings have been sporadic over the past decade or so. I like this one. It really shows the simple, coastal pleasantness of this Campbeltown distillery. Ripe malty notes are accompanied by brine, cut hay, banana cream pie, and honeyed vanilla. Lingering salty, malty finish. With all the sherried and wine-finished Springbanks recently on the market (not that there’s anything wrong with that), here’s a nice, no-frills, Campbeltown whisky. ",
"Glen Garioch Vintage 1995, 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,86,0 to 100 Dollars,"A marriage of two whiskies: 30% 18 year old Caol Ila finished in Chateau d’Yquem Sauternes casks and 70% 10 year old Bowmore finished in Grenache wine casks. A honeyed, sultana sweetness (from the d’Yquem?) nicely tames the rooty smoke, iodine, seaweed, brine, pepper, and subtle Spanish olive. Bramble and berried fruit (from the Grenache?) add another layer and dimension. A very dynamic whisky, worthy of exploring and debating how well all these flavors integrate with each other.",
"Glen Scotia 16 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,88,0 to 100 Dollars,"The rich, sweet Sauternes dessert wine adds its signature. Quite lush, with golden raisin, crème brûlée, rhubarb pie, honey-kissed citrus, and creamy vanilla. A lovely example of a dessert whisky — comforting, warming, and embracing. (I would also enjoy this after a brunch of crepes, fresh fruit, and maple syrup.) ",
"Balblair 1975, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,375,101 to 500 Dollars,"Aged in both refill and new bourbon casks. The new bourbon casks are evident, and I think it adds richness, vibrancy, and perceived maturity (which I like) when compared to the previous Summer 2010 release. Very pale in color. Brooding, with licorice root, coal tar, bacon fat, damp peat, bright fruit (citrus and pear), and intriguing botanicals, all on a soothing bed of vanilla malt. Smoky, briny finish. I’m still amazed how this very young whisky can taste so mature. Well done! ",
"Compass Box The Entertainer, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"Bright fruit throughout (red raspberry, strawberry-rhubarb pie, gooseberry, red currant, nectarine), honeyed malt, dark chocolate, tarry rope, seaweed soaked in olive brine, and ground pepper. Tarry finish. Nicely balanced, well-defined flavors, and fully mature at 10 years of age.",
"Glenfiddich Over 38 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,4664,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Refill sherry hogsheads have been used to mature the latest Gordon & MacPhail bottling of Clynelish, the most northerly distillery in Diageo’s portfolio. Initially quite earthy on the nose, with mustard seeds, pepper, and contrasting malt. Becoming progressively sweeter and less complex. Quite oily in texture, the earthiness carries over from the nose onto the palate, then sweet fruit notes, malt, and spice emerge, plus a delicate thread of smoke. The finish dries slowly, with a hint of peat.",
"Springbank Calvados Wood 12 year old, 52.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,105,101 to 500 Dollars,"Comprising 100 percent whisky matured in oloroso sherry casks, the Tay Dram is fresh and vibrant on the nose, with fruit and toffee. Fuller bodied than the Tweed or Dee Drams, with more overt evidence of sherry, followed through by honey, almonds, coffee, and toffee. Dark chocolate is to the fore in the lengthy finish — this time closer to chocolate orange confectionery. £42 Currently not available in the U.S.",
"Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Cragganmore), 1985 vintage, 22 year old, 56.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Quite youthful on the nose, with barley, vanilla, and finally nectarines. Smooth and medium-bodied, with floral notes, custard, and milk chocolate. A relatively short finish, with sappy oak.",
"Bunnahabhain 40 year old, 41.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,3104,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"A single cask of Ardmore aged in a first-fill bourbon cask and then finished in quarter casks. This one is more mature, with more depth than the standard Ardmore Traditional Cask (which I rated 80 a few years back). Notes of toffee, vanilla bean, chocolate fudge, licorice stick, bourbon, tar, charcoal, and a hint of burnt raisin. Very nice! (A Julio’s Liquors Exclusive.) ",
"Arran Premium Bourbon Single Cask (Cask 2096), 52%",Single Malt Scotch,87,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Following on from the earlier 8 year old expression of this triple distilled Campbeltown malt, the 12 year old first appeared in August 2009 and nicely illustrates the developments brought about by its continuing maturation. Rich on the nose, with a clear sherry influence, along with toffee, marzipan, apricots, and milk chocolate. This is a substantial and well integrated dram, with malt, almonds, cocoa, and spice on the palate, while the long, spicy finish offers more chocolate, soft fruits, and coffee.",
"Arran Orkney Bere, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

Citrus, exotic wood, and botanicals on the nose and palate. Indeed, there’s a bit of intrigue here. Nice balance, with roasted nuts, pecan pie, and more exotic wood on the finish. ",
"Wemyss Malts (distilled at Blair Athol) Autumn Berries, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,132,101 to 500 Dollars,"Scotland’s northernmost mainland distillery, located in the historic port of Wick, is owned by Inver House. The ‘entry level’ 12 year old expression is widely available. The nose presents pleasingly fresh malt and floral notes, with a touch of pine. The palate offers a fuller bodied, sweeter whisky than the nose might lead one to expect, with more malt, spices, fresh fruit, and a suggestion of salt. The finish is medium in length, drying, and decidedly nutty.",
"Glen Elgin 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,52,0 to 100 Dollars,"Edradour, in Perthshire, is owned by independent bottler Signatory, who has released a wide variety of expressions during the past few years. However, the standard 12 year old remains a classic of its kind.  Cider apples, malt, almonds, vanilla, and honey on the nose, along with a hint of smoke and sherry. The palate is creamy and malty, with a persistent nuttiness and quite pronounced sherry, plus a touch of leather. Spices and sherry dominate the medium to long finish. ",
"Highland Park Loki 15 year old, 48.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"The latest triple distilled bottling from the Lowland distillery of Auchentoshan has been matured for 35 years in bourbon casks and is presented non-chill filtered and at cask strength. Just 500 bottles are available globally. Apple crumble and custard on the nose, with developing cereal notes. Smooth and enticing. Spice, fresh fruits, honey, and marzipan on the buttery palate, which ultimately becomes drier. The finish is long and discreetly drying, with spices, malted barley, and a citrus tang in the tail. Price is approximate.",
"Edradour 'Ballechin (#4),' 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"First released in 2008, Peaty Tang is a blend of 4 to 5 year old heavily peated and 8 year old unpeated whiskies. Pipe tobacco on the nose, with damp undergrowth, canned pears, and smoked meat. Medium-bodied, with light sweet peat smoke, vanilla, cereal, green apples, and licorice on the palate. Dark chocolate, caramel, and tangy smoke in the short to medium finish.",
"The Dalmore Valour, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,72,0 to 100 Dollars,"Gordon & MacPhail bottled a 21 year old expression from Scotland’s northernmost mainland distillery for the U.S. market earlier this year. Sweet on the nose, with honey and vanilla; fleetingly, stewed apricots and peaches, plus a hint of caramel. Intensely focused, sweet tropical fruits on the palate, with barley sugar. Becoming nuttier, with an edge of mixed spices. Spice fading to milk chocolate in the medium-length finish, with just a suggestion of brine.",
"Wemyss Malts Ginger Spice (distilled at Glenrothes) 1988, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,164,101 to 500 Dollars,"Full gold in color, this Bunna initially has the lifted Moscatel aroma that’s reminiscent of a fine Darjeeling leaf tea, then comes melting milk chocolate and touches of sweet cinnamon toast. The palate continues in this sweet vein, but has the distillery’s characteristic thickness in the mid-palate, as well as plenty of its signature fresh ginger note. With water, there are some baked fruits and a hint of flowers. Altogether delicious and subtly complex.",
"Kilkerran Work in Progress 5 Sherry, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,58,0 to 100 Dollars,"The only Islay distillery not on the coast — and the most westerly on the island — Kilchoman is reviving the tradition of farm distilling, and this limited edition release uses locally grown Optic barley malted at the distillery. Very creamy, with some stewed apple, green banana, and (when diluted) sponge cake mix. The smoke develops on the palate, adding an earthy note. Rich, with some clove and licorice on the finish. Well worth a look. ",
"Wemyss Malts Heathery Smoke (distilled at Caol Ila) 30 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,230,101 to 500 Dollars,"This malt is actually 36 years old, having spent its first 34 years in a refill hogshead before two years of maturation in a first fill ex-Sauternes cask. The out-turn was 280 bottles. Mellow on the nose, with fresh oranges and apples, developing toffee, and violets. Smooth and fruity on the palate, with dark chocolate, pepper, and discreet tannins. Long in the finish, with fruity oak. £400",
"Douglas Laing Director’s Cut (distilled at Tomatin) 45 year old, 51.6%",Single Malt Scotch,87,353,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is a refill (or in 'Farclas terms, ‘plain’) hogshead, so there is less wood on show and more distillery. The nose is like a gentleman’s club at lunchtime: roasting meat, some pipe tobacco, polished wood, and the scent of a freshly-dug garden wafting through the windows. The palate shows slightly more fresh fruitiness (in line with the 1971 cask). There’s decent grip; think treacle this time. Fluxes and changes, which makes it all the more intriguing. £246",
"Hankey Bannister Heritage Blend, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,42,0 to 100 Dollars,"A refill hogshead this time, which when combined with its (relative) youth throws the distillery character into even greater focus. Positively light to start with, a green edge to the dry grass seen in the 1970s and more of the fruity notes hinted at in the 1982. All the time, though, it is anchored by meaty earthiness and that distinctive burnt note. The finish is a little short, but all in all a very appetizing example. £250",
"Adelphi (distilled at Glen Moray) 27 year old, 56.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,158,101 to 500 Dollars,"This oft-overlooked Speysider has been frustratingly variable in the past, but now seems to have hit greater consistency. Worm tubs and weird stills combine to give a complex malt, but one that needs help from oak to blossom fully. There are hedgerow aromas: black currant leaf, hawthorn berries, and lots of honey. A chestnut note continues on the tongue where, on the finish, a hint of smoke lurks. ",
"Glenfiddich Vintage Cask, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,111,101 to 500 Dollars,"Equally honeyed; in fact here the finish (oloroso this time) seems to enhance the sweetness. Out comes Manuka honey, Greek yogurt, and heavy blossom notes while the sherry itself brings in a nutty, polished note. There’s just a hint of sulfur when you add water (Dalwhinnie is a sulfury new make). The finish is long with some Brazil nut. Try frozen with dessert.",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular 21 year old (distilled at Glen Scotia), 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,137,101 to 500 Dollars,"A comparatively rare independent bottling of what is, in any case, a hard to find single malt. Distilled in 1990, matured in an American oak hogshead (#646), and bottled at cask strength. White pepper, damp earth, violets, cinnamon, and slight saltiness on the nose. The pepper blackens on the idiosyncratic palate, with cough syrup, big spice notes, and dark berries. Long and peppery in the finish, with developing oak tannins.",
"Port Charlotte Scottish Barley, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,87,72,0 to 100 Dollars,"The latest limited release in the Icons of Arran series was distilled in 1999 and matured in fourteen ex-bourbon barrels and seven sherry hogsheads. Initially launched in the UK, but global availability is anticipated. A sprinkling of coconut, vanilla, and spices, with pears, melons, and pineapple on the nose. Full and fruity on the palate, becoming maltier and nuttier. Sweet spices, especially stem ginger, and a hint of honey. Drying slowly in the very spicy finish (6,000 bottles). £42",
"Cadenhead’s (distilled at Caol Ila) 22 year old, 52.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,156,101 to 500 Dollars,"Though this has been on the shelves in the UK for a while, its U.S. release has been delayed. It shows a classic mature ‘Rothes nose, mixing moist fruitcake, vanilla, and a tickle of maltiness. What sets this apart is the weight of the stewed fruit and a dry note reminiscent of light rain on tweed. The palate is typically slow with a sparky spiciness and a lick of hazelnut butter to caress your throat. Worth the wait. ",
"Kilchoman 100% Islay 3rd Edition, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,87,92,0 to 100 Dollars,"A vatting of sherry casks from (apparently) royally significant dates with an outturn of 2012 (get it?) bottles. Auburn in color, it has a fruit compote nose mixed with citrus, and a little hint of gravy browning in the background. This mix of the exotic—oil of clove on the tongue, the sweet and light grip—makes for a very intriguing, concentrated, and layered palate. Think of Turkish Delight and crystallized ginger. Try the distillery shop for stock. £350",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Aberfeldy, Batch 1), 47%",Single Malt Scotch,87,105,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is the latest in an ongoing series of releases of whisky distilled at the Campbeltown distillery of Glengyle, and now aged 8 years. Just 9,000 bottles are available. The nose is full, with over-ripe oranges, warm honey, and custard. On the palate, the oranges are fresher and livelier, with vanilla, hard toffee, and a slightly citric fruit edge to balance the sweetness. That sweetness carries over into the spicy finish, which is quite lengthy, with a lick of licorice. £35",
"Glencadam 30 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,451,101 to 500 Dollars,"Peat smoke indeed, and it dovetails nicely with light toffee, vanilla, anise, charred oak, blackberry, seaweed, kalamata olive, brine, and peppercorn. Well balanced from start to lingering smoke finish, and very exciting. (Exclusive to the U.S.)",
"Compass Box Great King Street Experimental OO-V4, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,48,0 to 100 Dollars,"As part of a rebranding of the entire Talisker range, Diageo has brought its Special Releases 25 and 30 year old cask strength expressions into the full-time fold, reduced in strength to 45.8%. Sweet and buttery on the nose; soft fruits and fragrant malt, milk chocolate, and dry, crumbling peat. Citrus fruits (notably lemon), licorice sticks, black pepper, and scorched wood on the palate. Dry and oaky in the lengthy finish, with peat notes and allspice to the end. £300 ",
"Cardhu 21 year old, 54.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,267,101 to 500 Dollars,"One of two new Glen Garioch vintages to be produced under the auspices of Morrison Bowmore Distillers’ master blender Rachel Barrie, this 1995 offering is due to appear in the U.S. next year. 1,000 cases are available and maturation has taken place in first-fill bourbon casks. Spice, vanilla, pears, honey, and very discreet smoke on the nose. Hazelnuts, baked bananas, apple strudel, and lots of spice on the sweet creamy palate, backed up by a gentle note of lingering char. £55",
"Port Ellen 34 year old, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,87,2000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"The nose gives a whiff of vanilla fudge, then black pepper, sea salt, and a savory note develops. The palate yields maritime-tinged candied fruits and effervescent smoke. Slightly tarry in the finish. Macho!",
"Pentland Skerries, 46%,",Single Malt Scotch,87,92,0 to 100 Dollars,"Balblair has followed up the first release of its 1975 vintage bottling with a second, which differs significantly in character, having been matured in American oak sherry casks, whereas the initial release had been aged in Spanish oak sherry casks. Floral, mellow, and slightly oily on the nose, with a savory background and ready-salted crisps. Silky smooth on the palate, with citrus fruit, a hint of wood smoke, coconut, and honey. The finish is spicy, with aniseed and oak.",
"Auchentoshan Silveroak 1990, 50.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,145,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is a special bottling for London department store Selfridge's, but it represents a clever strategy by artisan Compass Box to set its own agenda by regionalizing its whiskies. This is a long way from the New York blend—indeed, creamier and sweeter than other recent releases. It has a honey heart, traces of cinnamon, and menthol in the mix, plus wispy smoke. There's some spice and peat late on, but in relatively subdued form. Very pleasant. £85",
"Wemyss Malts Brandy Casket (distilled at Glen Garioch) 1989, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"Surprisingly pale (you see the issue, Macallan?), but long aging in refill casks helps eliminate the bluntness of oak and can produce aromas that have been reduced and then taken into an exotic realm; here manifested as quince paste and kumquat followed by crystallized and candied fruits. The palate is subtle and soft with light heat, toasted chocolate, white currant, and then overwhelming cherry blossom. Exotic is the word. Bottled for China, but may be given a wider release. £3,000",
"Wemyss Malts Toffee Glaze 1997 (distilled at Clynelish), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,68,0 to 100 Dollars,"This expression from the Campbeltown distillery of Springbank was distilled in April 2000, matured for six years in refill bourbon barrels, and then for another six years in Calvados casks. The outturn was 9,420 bottles. Toffee apples dipped in soft spices on the nose, with a follow through of vanilla. Quite viscous on the palate, with white wine, red peppers, and cinnamon, along with a tang of peat. Lime marmalade and a touch more peat in the relatively dry finish.  ",
"The Whisky Exchange (distilled at Linkwood) 16 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,87,108,101 to 500 Dollars,"The latest bottling of “Breath” is like a whisky smuggler’s tale. There’s the smell of old waxed walking boots, wet moss, damp earth, crushed bog foliage — heather, bog myrtle — burlap sacking, and a hastily smothered fire. The smoke is well controlled all the way, which helps to allow its scents to run over bitter coffee and a balancing central sweetness. Robust, hairy, and uncompromising, this is less of a breath and more of a roar. £65 ",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Kilchoman, Batch 1), 55.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,117,101 to 500 Dollars,"Here’s an Islay distillery which has never quite had the investment it deserves. Hopefully this limited release is the start of an addressing of that situation. It has a classic nose with ginger (crystallized) to the fore alongside toasted almond and the balsamic note that you sometimes get with extra-mature whiskies, manifested here as mulberry vinegar. The mouth has coconut, some grip, and — though it fades a little speedily — retained fire. Take with water on the side. £1,999",
"Talisker Triple Matured Edition, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,87,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"This U.S.-exclusive Premium Bourbon Single cask #2096 contrasts nicely with its sherry cask-matured sibling, and offers vanilla, cocoa powder, malt extract, ripe bananas, and spicy sultanas on the nose. The palate is smooth and spicy, with ginger snaps and developing butteriness. The finish is medium to long, with chili notes and citrus fruits at the last. ",
"Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice (distilled at Macduff) 2000, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,76,0 to 100 Dollars,"The ancient variety of barley known as bere that was used to make this Arran single malt was grown on Orkney and distilled in 2004. It was matured for eight years in bourbon barrels, and 5,800 bottles have been released. Very fruity on the nose, principally peaches, with vanilla and fudge, something slightly herbal, wet grass, and finally homemade lemonade. Oily mouthfeel, with fresh oak, cloves, and wild berries. An atypical Arran! The finish is drying and moreish. £48",
"Tweeddale Single Lowland Malt 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,84,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distilled in 1986, this single cask from Blair Athol distillery in Perthshire yielded 268 bottles, and the nose offers sweet fruits, principally apple and orange, plus walnuts, vanilla, and brittle toffee. Becoming softer and creamier with time. Dark fruit notes on the palate, notably blackcurrants and cranberries, with caramel and cinnamon. The finish is quite viscous, with a little oak, freshly-squeezed lemons, and licorice twists. £85 ",
"Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Longmorn) 1992, 49.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"The least well-known of the Fogwatt trio which includes Longmorn and BenRiach, it’s unlikely that Glen Elgin will become a major brand anytime soon, given how important it is to blenders. A combination of long, slow ferments, and distillation coupled with worm tubs gives a ludicrously fruity spirit, which here is bulging with ripe peach, apricot, and Galia melon coated in cinnamon and nutmeg, given thick weight by the worm tubs. A classic. £34",
"Glenfarclas Family Casks 1969 (Cask #2545), 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,1456,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Following on from Thor, Loki is the second release in Highland Park’s Valhalla Collection. Loki has been matured in a mix of sherry and heavily-peated casks. Initial notes of marzipan on the nose, then orange, oriental spices, and chili. In time, yellow plums, vanilla, and floral notes. Soft and sweet on the palate, with pink grapefruit, overt smoke, and a touch of salt. The finish features contrasting barbecue and vanilla notes, citrus, and lots of spice.",
"Caol Ila 2002 Feis Ile 2014 bottling, 55.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,167,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 15 year old bottling of Diageo’s Sutherland single malt comes courtesy of The Creative Whisky Co., whose Exclusive Malts range of single cask, cask strength Scotch malt whiskies has recently been imported into the U.S. Fleeting burnt sugar on the nose, then mango and brittle toffee. Vanilla emerges, with slightly smoky malt. Finally, cloves. Mouth-coating, with lively spices, fruit and nut milk chocolate on the palate. Relatively long in the finish, with ginger snaps and a wax-like texture.",
"Kilchoman Coull Point, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,76,0 to 100 Dollars,"The Dalmore has added a new expression to its Travel Retail portfolio, namely Valour. This variant carries no age statement and maturation began in first-fill bourbon casks and 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts before undergoing a finishing period in port pipes. The result is a nose of black currants, caramel, and musty sherry. The palate is medium-sweet, with damsons, Jaffa oranges, and printer’s ink. Dark berries emerge in time. The finish embraces drying spices, figs, and mildly astringent oak.",
"Carn Mor (distilled at Ben Nevis) 1997, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,93,0 to 100 Dollars,"Glenrothes always has a spicy element, but this example ups the ante considerably and, true to the label, it’s fresh-cut ginger root alongside galangal and coriander, a hint of green grass, and even a little bite of jelly babies, alongside black currant leaf. Rothes’ normally languid air is here frothily exuberant, with just sufficient vanilla thickness to offer a brake. Uplifting and good. £107",
"Exclusive Malts North Highland 17 year old 1996 Cask # 7025, 56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,87,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Having released four previous “work in progress” expressions of Kilkerran, 2013 sees the launch of two editions, one matured in sherry casks and the other in bourbon barrels. The sherry-aged variant yields overripe green grapes and figs on the nose, followed by honey and plain chocolate, while the palate is quite full, softly fruity, with soft toffee and a hint of brine. The finish dries significantly, with cocoa powder, licorice, and lots of spice. £38",
"Tomatin 1988 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"Sweet oak and cod liver oil are what greet you, with fleshy, lychee-like fruits
behind. The smoke here is very polite, giving way to fruit jelly cubes and
peaches, to develop alongside crisp apple. The palate is clean with nutty oak, with
the smoke continuing in the background, offering an extra layer of complexity.
Fresh, belying its age, while it has typical tongue-coating oiliness it remains
understated. Caol Ila basking in the summer sun. (U.S. only)",
"Tomatin Cù Bòcan 1989 Limited Edition, 53.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,337,101 to 500 Dollars,"This veteran example of Tomatin was distilled in November 1967 and matured for 45 years in refill butt #9315. The outturn was
175 bottles. Uncompromising dark sherry and treacle notes on the fruity nose, along with gunpowder tea. Big, old sherry notes on the full palate, with raisins, sultanas, and a sprinkling of black pepper. Fruity, notably spicy, and not too drying for its age in a relatively supple finish. £230",
"The Famous Grouse Double Matured 16 year old Vic Lee Edition, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,99,0 to 100 Dollars,"Hankey Bannister includes some stunning aged whiskies in its range, but given the trend toward unaged scotch releases, I was a bit suspicious of this. It lacks depth but nevertheless is a butterfly in a breeze of a whisky; gossamer light, both tantalizing and elusive. It’s liquid honey, with sweet lime and pear, some cocoa, and to give it a modicum of depth, it’s underpinned
by a light saltiness.",
"Lord Elcho, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,43,0 to 100 Dollars,"Each independent bottler has its own signature style. Adelphi’s is about relaxed, contemplative drams with rich maturity and a certain seriousness. Here you see this, plus crème brûlée, sitting in front of a sandalwood backdrop with a bunch of basil mint thrown in. The opening is slow, and while the inherent sweet nature of the distillery is there, hazelnuttish oak helps to add structure and stops any flabbiness from intruding. A luscious dram. £99",
"Wemyss Malts (distilled at Tormore) 1988 Floral Trellis, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,189,101 to 500 Dollars,"One of a trio of new whiskies that have spent time in Glenfiddich’s new solera vats, this will surprise many because of its overt smokiness that’s like a bonfire in a pear orchard. Some ferny greenness adds to the freshness. The reverse happens on the palate, with the smoke being held in check by the soft mouthfeel (which could be solera-enhanced), ripe fruits, and gentle creaminess. (Travel Retail; Asia only, currently.)£70",
"Craigellachie 17 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,132,101 to 500 Dollars,"Whiskies in Douglas Laing’s new Old Particular range are non-chill filtered and bottled at three strengths, with those aged 19 years and over being offered at 51.5%. This Glen Scotia was distilled in May 1992 and boasts a nose of violets, musky malt, soft smoke, and a fresh sea breeze. Big, spicy, and quite oily on the palate, with dark berries, black tea, and a note of tar. Long and dark in the finish, with oak tannins and persistent licorice. £85",
"Kilkerran Work in Progress 6 Sherry Matured, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Smoky, yes, but the effect is more shore-like: on the beach, hot sand, wood smoke, and a faint hint of balloons…there must be a party going on. In addition you get olive oil, preserved lemon, and eucalyptus. The palate is thick with strawberry sweeties that push back against the peat. Water calms things (suggesting this would work with soda), while the finish sees the campfire emit more smoke. £45",
"Bowmore Devil’s Cask Batch 2, 56.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"With no great wood on show, this is a Caol Ila which is time—not oak—driven. A very scented, nay herbal start, like bouquet garni with light smoke, grapefruit, sea-washed stones, ozone, and heather blossom. The retention of aromatics is gorgeous. Water increases the peat effect but diminishes the aromatics, so take your choice. Well worth a look.",
"Caol Ila Unpeated 15 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 60.39%",Single Malt Scotch,87,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Here you have the sweetness of rising bread alongside scallop and wreathes of smoke, all lit by west coast sunshine; the peat isn’t dank, but bright and flaming. The palate is sweetly seductive before the smoke begins to come through, then it sweetens like golden syrup, then the shore comes back, and so it continues. Water ups the impact of each, so be careful, as it can then seem disconnected. Sweet, beachy, smoky. Very Islay.",
"Gordon & MacPhail Cask Strength 1995 (distilled at Aberfeldy), 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"Independent releases of the Perthshire single malt Aberfeldy are relatively rare, and the first batch of That Boutique-y Whisky Company’s no age statement Aberfeldy runs to 155 numbered bottles. The nose features coconut ice, vanilla, malt, candied peel, and ginger. Good mouthfeel, with more malt, ginger-nut biscuits, icing sugar, and milk chocolate. The finish is drying, with oak and black pepper. £65/500 ml",
"Balblair 2003, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is a single cask (#729) bottling, distilled in 1982, and the outturn was just 260 bottles. Soft and supple on the waxy nose, with worn leather, Jaffa oranges, and malt. Lots of leather, with brittle toffee, orange creams, and a slightly musty note on the full palate. Mouth-drying in the lengthy finish, but the tannins never come close to overwhelming. £280",
"Old Masters Freemason Whisky, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,30,0 to 100 Dollars,"Great King Street was our Blend of the Year two years ago and Compass Box wondered where to take it next. So they have released two versions, asking customers to decide between them by voting online. The other one is peated and will probably win easily, which is a shame, because this is a more subtle and better whisky. Sherry, syrup, honey, apple, and sultanas are all here, but nuanced. Delightful. £30",
"Highland Queen 1561 30 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,302,101 to 500 Dollars,"There appears to be a concerted effort to bring this distillery out of the shadows: A Good Thing in my opinion. This limited
release is very Cardhu, with masses of mandarin, dried peach, and honey, reminiscent of a fine oxidized Chinese Phoenix Oolong tea, while still retaining the effervescent buzz of youth. Akin to a fine Cuban rum on the tongue, with bittersweet chocolate, dark cherry, and tangy, spicy life, it dies a little quickly, but is a lovely dram. £160",
"Anchor Bay, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,48,0 to 100 Dollars,"Here’s a classical Port Ellen, where the intense, even monomaniacal delivery of smoke mixes with damp face flannel, purple smoke, green ferns, and rapeseed oil. Lots of minerality, to the point of being almost flintily uncompromising. Water makes it more naked. The palate is excellent, with an explosion of preserved lemon-accented smokiness, touches of Spanish paprika, a sweet syrupy center, before a massive licorice finish. Peatiness for the purist, but whenever was that different? (2,958 bottles).",
"Haig Club, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,72,0 to 100 Dollars,"Maturation of the Pentland Skerries bottling of the Lighthouse Collection has taken place exclusively in former Spanish sherry casks, which lends the nose rich, dark sherry and Christmas cake notes, caramel and old leather, along with the distillery’s characteristic saltiness, which here comes across as salted peanuts. Full-bodied and slick in the mouth, overt sherry, sultanas, figs, spice, and contrasting brine. Mild maritime notes and autumn fruits combine with prunes and sherry in an accomplished, after-dinner finish. £55/liter",
"Sovereign (distilled at Cameronbridge) 23 year old 1990, 59.2%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,127,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is the second batch of Silveroak 1990 from Auchentoshan, and it has benefited from an extra year of maturation in bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. The 22 year old is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets. Notably floral on the nose, with fudge, banana, ginger, and attractive oak. On the palate it delivers vanilla, apricots, apples, more ginger, and oak. The finish is long and spicy, with dark coffee notes and a hint of menthol. Greater complexity than its predecessor.",
"Highland Journey, 46.2%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,63,0 to 100 Dollars,"Wemyss Malts has bottled this 23 year old hogshead-matured example of Glen Garioch from the Aberdeenshire village of Oldmeldrum. Just 322 bottles were yielded by the cask. Cigarette tobacco, brittle toffee, and a hint of aniseed on the nose. Vanilla develops, along with strawberries, apples, and pears. Rich malt, walnuts, cooked apple, and cinnamon on the palate. The spicy finish features old leather and pepper. £105 ",
"Exclusive Malts Speyside 10 year old 2004, 57.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"The latest Wemyss single cask release of Clynelish from the distillery at Brora in Sutherland runs to 258 bottles and has been matured in a hogshead. Freshly-sliced green apples on the nose, slightly peppery, with grated nutmeg and salted caramels. Relatively full-bodied, with lots of soft fruit, principally Jaffa oranges, and sweet spice. Spicy caramel and cocoa powder in the slowly drying, medium-length finish. £75",
"Glen Grant 50 year old, 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,87,14999,10001 and above,"The combination of Linkwood and sherry cask can be to the detriment of such a perfumed whisky. Not here. The nose speaks of caramel toffee, demerara sugar, and while an oaky touch is there it’s light, allowing plump sultanas, rose, and a delightful balsamic cider vinegar note to emerge. The palate is relaxed and gentle, with darker fruits. There’s sufficient body to cope with the tannic squeeze. It needs water to reach ideal balance. Lovely. £65",
"Glenrothes Vintage Reserve, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Startlingly herbal. Penetrating, lifted, and aromatic with dill, mint, and in time, celery leaf and lovage. Smoke is akin to freshly-laid tarmac with some sweet seaweed behind. Lively and quite different to the official bottling. Water brings unripe pineapple, clove, sugared almond, and horseradish. This has typical Kilchoman sweet creaminess in the center. Water brings out flavors of nettles, and saltiness. £69",
"Longrow Red 11 year old Port Cask, 51.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,82,0 to 100 Dollars,"This no age statement Talisker is one of the first “triple matured” (so-named) whiskies exclusive to Friends of The Classic Malts. Successive periods of aging occurred in refill casks, charred American oak hogsheads, and European oak refill casks. Ozone, fresh asphalt, dried fruits, and old leather on the nose. A big pepper hit in the mouth, backed by earthy peat, Elastoplast, vanilla, and citrus fruits. The pepper lasts right to the end in the long, steadily-drying, charcoal-fueled finish. £80",
"Grand Macnish Black Edition, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,30,0 to 100 Dollars,"Gordon & MacPhail’s latest bottling from Macduff distillery is a year 2000 distillation, matured in refill sherry hogsheads. American cream soda and light spices on the nose, with honey, and white pepper development. Ultimately, rum and raisin fudge. Smooth and supple in the mouth, with apple peel, soft fino sherry, and nutmeg. The finish is medium in length, with spicy fruit notes. £45",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glenburgie) 25 year old, 49.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,190,101 to 500 Dollars,"This unspecified single malt has been bottled non-chill filtered in single cask format. Maturation took place in a barrel that formerly contained Islay single malt. Initially earthy on the nose, with potato skins, salt, and white pepper. Time in the glass teases out fruity, caramel sweetness. The palate is very sweet and zesty, with orange sherbet, along with a nicely integrated maritime note which becomes more pronounced. The finish is spicy and mildly medicinal. £50",
"The Exclusive Malts (distilled at BenRiach) 17 year old 1997 (cask #144744), 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"Longmorn always has this fruitcake thing going on and this is no exception. A sherry hoggie  helped provide sultana, cake mix, grilled almond, rhubarb puree, and a little cigar box. The palate is very fruity, with light Darjeeling-like tannins, then red fruits. It becomes nuttier as it moves and needs water to add ripeness to the stone fruit base. Highly recommended and extremely well priced. £80",
"The Exclusive Malts Islay 7 year old 2007 (cask #904), 54.6%",Single Malt Scotch,87,145,101 to 500 Dollars,"This comes from a refill butt and has a light, paler color. The lack of huge oak interaction has given an amazing freshness; think of freshly-applied plaster, syrup, hot green bracken, a touch of nuttiness. It takes water well, allowing pure, soft fruits to come through, and it is these which become almost syrup-like in the mouth, while never losing Glenfarclas’ central depth and roasty richness in the center. £865",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glen Moray) 14 year old, 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,87,83,0 to 100 Dollars,"Restrained, ozonic, with no great smokiness to open, but there is a touch of green grass behind meadow flowers and salt-washed stones so typical of the distillery. With water another marker—drying fishing nets—comes through, with breaths of the sea. Subtle and refined. More smoke on the palate, where it’s like a flowering currant bush on fire. Great balance of different elements: smoke, fragrance, oil, acidity. With water, real saltiness comes through. Very good. £99",
"Wemyss Malts Stem Ginger Preserve (distilled at Mortlach) 1995, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,133,101 to 500 Dollars,"This strikes me as being the most overtly smoky of Kilchoman’s recent bottlings, and also the sweetest. Intense and very forward, there’s baked apple, humidor notes, honeydew melon, fresh shellfish. Water brings out a putty-like youthfulness, so take it neat. The palate is amazingly sweet (think golden syrup), then the smoke folds itself over. A good—and well-priced—introduction for newcomers.(World of Whiskies UK Travel Retail only) £45",
"Glen Scotia Victoriana, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,115,101 to 500 Dollars,"This single cask 17 year old expression of Ben Nevis was matured in a sherry butt which yielded 747 bottles. It appears in Carn Mor’s “Strictly Limited” series of releases and has not been chill filtered. The bold nose opens with slightly savory notes and hard-boiled eggs. Sherry, malt, and figs subsequently develop. Quite full-bodied, with rich Jaffa orange and developing plain chocolate on the palate. More dark chocolate and a suggestion of fennel in the medium-length finish. £55",
"Rock Oyster, 46.8%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,59,0 to 100 Dollars,"From an undisclosed North Highland distillery, aged in a refill sherry hogshead. The impact of the sherry is clear, with ripe blackberry and peach. A floral, sweet, clover honey note rounds out a deliciously lush mouthfeel. This lushness is well balanced by a spicy mid-palate that features black pepper, ginger, and strong salinity that help provide some real depth. A long and slightly dry finish wraps up a solid whisky. (U.S. only)",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Imperial) 1995, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,87,325,101 to 500 Dollars,"This vintage expression from Tomatin has been matured in a mix of bourbon and port casks, and is being released in batches. The first comprises 2,500 bottles. The soft, fragrant nose offers strawberries, apricots, honey, and caramel, with a final hint of dry port. Fruit and caramel notes carry over from the nose onto the palate before dark chocolate appears, along with a suggestion of smoke. Subtle oak and ginger in the lengthy finish.",
"Kilkerran Work in Progress VII – Bourbon, 54.1%",Single Malt Scotch,87,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"Tomatin launched the peated Cù Bòcan expression last year, and follows it with a vintage variant, the result of “…a rare and unintentional production of peated whisky at the distillery on 7th June 1989.” Three bourbon casks yielded 1,080 bottles. Ripe apples and aerosol furniture polish, with a vanilla and sweet woodsmoke backdrop on the nose. Full-bodied, with intense, sweet fruit notes on the palate, and a heathery, smoky kick. Smoky spice and nutty flavors in the ultimately drying finish. £200",
"Blair Athol, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Aged in refill sherry casks. One taste bears this out with its dominant honeyed fruit foundation (lemons, melons, pineapple). Still, that Bruichladdich freshness and appetizing ""sea breeze"" character dovetails nicely. Fuller, more rounded, and with a bit more going on here than the Full Strength expression reviewed below, but not as appetizing.",
"Dalwhinnie Distillers Edition 1997, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"Lord Elcho was an 18th century ancestor of William Wemyss, who fought on Bonnie Prince Charlie’s side at the Battle of Culloden in 1745. With a minimum of 40% malt, this fine blend has a rather perfumed nose of fresh mint, green apple, sliced melon, and tropical fruits. The soft candy sugar and butterscotch palate builds, with layers of malt, cherry laces, gingerbread, and pfeffernüsse leading to a ginger and spice finish of significant length. Highly accomplished. £26",
"Royal Brackla 21 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,270,101 to 500 Dollars,"The nose is sweet (think barley sugar/boiled sweets) with little bits of wheat chaff flying around in the background with dried flower petals and drying cut grass. Opens dramatically with water into almond milk/horchata and flowers. The palate is sweet and lifted with those gentle florals to the fore. Instead of Tormore’s normal nagging rigidity, this flows sweetly over the tongue, leaving fruit leather, stewed rhubarb, and with water, rosewater and fresh wild strawberry. A lovely Tormore! £118",
"The Antiquary 35 year old, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,460,101 to 500 Dollars,"Golden, lifted, and aromatic. The fleshy ripeness of the 13 year old is still there, but that little sulfur edge has now gone, revealing the ripe fruits massing underneath. Now you find pineapple and light chalk. The flowers have become daffodils and bluebells rather than lily, along with a soft, vanilla ice cream plumpness. Sweet and full, and just a shade lighter than the 13 year old. Muscly, but sweet; that’s the paradox of the Craigellachie character. £83",
"The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 1978 37 year old (Cask #2708), 50.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,6542,5001 to 10000 Dollars,"The latest releases from Glengoyne distillery are 10 year olds, one matured in sherry wood and one in bourbon barrels, as was the case with release 5. 9,000 bottles are available globally. Initially savory on the nose, slightly earthy, with sherry, new leather, lemonade, and a hint of ozone. Spicy and zesty, with developing stewed fruits, dark chocolate, and deep sherry notes on the palate. The finish is long and persistently spicy, mildly smoky, with quite dry sherry notes.",
"Cadenhead’s (distilled at Braes of Glenlivet) 16 year old, 56.9%",Single Malt Scotch,84,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"A “branded” malt, meaning we don’t know which distillery this whisky came from. Fresh and quite fruity (peach, nectarine, golden raisin, orange, pineapple) with a nice underlying honey, vanilla, and caramel sweetness. Soft, gentle, malty finish. It’s clean, nicely balanced, and pleasant.",
"Springbank Green 13 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,77,0 to 100 Dollars,"The now-annual unpeated release shows its high strength on the nose, but under the burn is a clean, mineral, and slightly lean Caol Ila with just a tiny whiff of smoke. A mix of grassiness/herbal notes, with delicate white fruits that plump out into tinned fruit salad, gooseberry, and fresh pineapple. The palate is sweet and cake-like, while the heat enhances its salty tang. Delightful, sweet, and long. (10,668 bottles)",
"Glen Garioch 15 year old The Renaissance Chapter One, 51.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,108,101 to 500 Dollars,"This expression from Aberfeldy was distilled in April 1995 and bottled in January 2014 after maturation in refill, remade sherry hogsheads (casks #2,488, 2,489, and 2,491). The nose is floral, with ginger and developing milk chocolate. Progressively sweeter, with slight sherry and vanilla notes. The palate is silky and sweet, with banoffee pie, peaches, and spicy oak. The finish is long, with cocoa powder and more spiced oak. £60",
"Glenmorangie A Midwinter Night's Dram, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,58,0 to 100 Dollars,"Balblair Vintage 2003 replaces the previous 2002 expression, matured in second-fill bourbon barrels, with the contents of eighteen making up this first release. Tinned peaches and apricot jam on the nose, with underlying honey and caramel. Early malt, then zesty lemon notes on the palate, which also features freshly-cut grass and hazelnuts. The medium-length finish yields white pepper and cocoa powder.",
"Arran The Bothy Quarter Cask, 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Originally created by Lombard for the Freemasons, this has a flavorsome nose of dark chocolate chip cookies, light spices, coconut macaroons, malt, and bright, fresh bananas. The palate is light and unobtrusive, with honey and malt reinforced by the spices running underneath. A shift develops to some later cocoa and chocolate notes, and the mocha finish fades gracefully. A finely balanced concoction, and you will rarely find this quality and flavor for the price",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky #1 (Batch 2), 52%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,178,101 to 500 Dollars,"A limited edition blend with more than 75 percent malt content, containing grains from 1978 and 1979, and malts from 1982. A genteel nose exudes white chocolate, vanilla slice, butterscotch, fresh apricots, and salted pecans. Commanding and rich, it luxuriates in bitter orange, ripe apricots, marmalade, dairy toffees, cinnamon, and raspberry, with a finish of Seville orange rind. It’s a little blander with water, toward baked lemons and barley sugar, so resist and take it as it comes. £190",
"The Macallan Edition No. 1, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,87,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"Lombard’s blend of Speyside malts pleases with an agreeable nose of orchard blossoms, flower honey, caramel, dry hay, and pears baked in brown granulated sugar. It’s homey and comforting, favoring its floral and fruity side. This is a light, sweet whisky that sweeps around the mouth, radiating maltiness, apple, grapefruit, dried mango strips, and mingling spices. A studiously long finish of sucked caramel candy and beeswax follows. A smart choice for the beginning of the evening. £30",
"Ardbeg Dark Cove, 46.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"A confectioner’s delight; Fry’s Five Centres, lime, lemon, kumquat, iced buns, fresh mint, and crushed cardamom that matches the chocolate aromas. Those re-charred, rejuvenated casks are very much in evidence here. It has a gilded, satiny sheen, glistening with lemon drizzle cake, butterscotch, orange matchsticks, and banana bread. Incontrovertibly, it inhabits a signature grain style, but it fizzles out with a sticky, sweet aftertaste, like licking the spoon from the icing bowl. £45",
"Balblair 2005, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Appearances can be deceptive, as this pallid specimen proves. Overripe honeydew melons, lemon cheesecake sprinkled with zest, vanilla pear muffins, cooked apple, spring blossoms, and icing sugar. The sweet, sugary opener is burnt out enjoyably by blistering burnt orange, butterscotch, and lemon bonbons. While the flavor intensity builds commendably, it doesn’t escape without a touch of astringency. Water makes this sing ‘Oranges and Lemons,’ but go easy with it. The finish is like a greedy mouthful of tarte au citron. £80",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glenturret) 1987, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,151,101 to 500 Dollars,"This was inspired by Stewart Laing’s childhood journeys by steam locomotive from Glasgow to Speyside with his father. Hunter Laing’s blended malt includes contributions from Blair Athol, Teaninich, and Clynelish and raises toffee sauce, dried banana chips, and spring foliage, with a fringe of fresh mint. You can appreciate the cool, clean taste; ripe banana and chocolate-dipped fudge blooming into late notes of mocha, ginger, and chocolate mousse. Dry finish of ginger cookies and espresso. All aboard! £40",
"Wemyss Malts Waffles and Ice Cream (distilled at Clynelish) 1997, 54.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,144,101 to 500 Dollars,"This cask strength, port cask-aged whisky comes from an undisclosed distillery near Aberlour. The impact of the port cask is unmistakable, with a nose that is deeply fruity with dried apricot, blackberry jam, honey, and malt. On the palate these rich sweet fruit notes are well balanced by black pepper, clove, salt, honey, and a touch of dark chocolate. The underlying proof also helps counterbalance the sweet fruit and drives a medium length and slightly dry finish. (U.S. only)",
"Highland Park ICE Edition, 53.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,270,101 to 500 Dollars,"Deep ruby with a yellow rim. Clearly mature, and heavily sherried. A highly concentrated nose: Marmite and soy sauce, and all the fresh fruits of youth reduced to essence. Drinkwise, it’s closest to Chinato: curative barks, dried herbs (mint, hyssop, oregano). The palate is unsurprisingly thick and lightly smoky, but the tannins aren't overly astringent, and there remains a sweet core still, even if the overall effect is dark. It’s not obviously Glen Grant, but it is a fascinating glass.",
"Ladyburn 41 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,1750,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"A new NAS, this has a thick, silky nose in classic ‘Rothes style which reminds you of coffee cream icing, hazelnut syrup, semi-dried soft fruits, and horchata. The palate has elegance and poise, with a hint of menthol lifting off into pecan and light grippy oak. Has excellent length and mellow flow. Water slightly reduces its voluptuous charms, so be careful (or simply avoid). Praise for revealing all the vintages used, and the fantastic price. Chapeau! £39",
"Royal Mile Whiskies 40 year old, 47.1%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,288,101 to 500 Dollars,"The latest incarnation of Springbank’s Longrow Red matured for 11 years in port casks before being bottled at cask strength. The nose is sweet, with cherries, caramel, new leather, chewing tobacco, and soft peat. Voluptuous in the mouth, with a palate of rich peat, summer berries, and toffee apples, with growing spice notes, and light oak. Lengthy in the finish, with cinnamon, peat, sweet oak, and red berries.",
"Signatory Vintage 10 year old (distilled at Edradour, Cask 41), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"I am hopeful this blended whisky has benefited from the alligator char treatment to contribute to the deep, rich color and charred smoke notes on the nose. A thick, velvety mouthfeel, with butter toffee, toasted marshmallows going gooey on a stick, great spices, vanilla, whole nutmeg, chicory, and the crust of a well-fired fruit loaf leaving some sooty cinders on the finish. A mighty fireside companion and my favorite Grand Macnish to date.",
"Jura 16 year old Diurachs’ Own, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Full gold. Big, robust, and sweetly fragrant, with honeysuckle, stewing elderflower. There’s some oak, but it’s not dominant. The palate starts creamy, then there’s some caramel toffee with good distillery character. It melds freshness with the extra weight gained by gentle maturation. There’s coconut and cassia on the end. You lose the sweetness with water, but you get more blossom and oak. Personally I’d go for it neat and sip slowly as a perfect summer dram. £130",
"Compass Box Enlightenment, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"BenRiach releases of this age are often peated or in a special barrel; here, we have an unpeated, non-barrel finish release. The nose is inviting, with Honeycrisp apple, toffee, malt, and a touch of oak. A very flavorful entry presents lush toffee, apple, malt, and ginger. The spice increases in the mid-palate, as well as the heat, but we don’t get much added complexity. A long, flavorful, and slightly dry finish round out a very tasty but ultimately simplistic whisky. (U.S. only)",
"Mannochmore 25 year old, 53.4%",Single Malt Scotch,87,400,101 to 500 Dollars,"An Islay single malt of unknown origin aged in a bourbon barrel showcases many of the classic notes of a peated malt of this age with smoke, iodine, paste, and oak. On the palate the smoky peat unfolds nicely, as it’s exquisitely balanced by honey, salt, and caramel. The smoke intensifies in the mid-palate but never loses its balance with the sweeter undertones. A dry, long, smoky finish caps off a well-integrated and very enjoyable mystery malt. (U.S. only)",
"BenRiach Tawny Port Wood Finish 21 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,137,101 to 500 Dollars,"Soft and direct. The initial impression is of birthday cake icing with marzipan beneath, then comes preserved lemon, greengage, and discreet maltiness. It becomes more scented (linden/privet blossom) in time. The palate is a little strong initially, then a hint of coconut. Improves further with water, showing a fascinating, subtle evolution: herbal with iris flowers. A classy dram from an overlooked distillery. Check it out. £53",
"Glenfiddich Project XX, 47%",Single Malt Scotch,87,62,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is Mortlach in musing mode. An aroma that initially brings to mind a woolen mill, then opens into sweet spice, light syrup, with the sense of the distillery’s weight always present. A rippling kind of muscularity with some rapeseed oil. With water the palate starts lighter and more fruity than you’d expect, then comes rooty weight with, yes, a distinctly gingery slant. Water shows more beeswax/honeycomb. Substantial and spicy. £85",
" GlenDronach Cask Strength (batch 5), 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,72,0 to 100 Dollars,"The most expensive of Glen Scotia’s new trio has been finished in deeply-charred barrels and bottled non-chill filtered at cask strength. Soft and sweet on the nose, with peaches, fudge, and a hint of oak. Full-bodied and slightly oily on the palate, with wood spices, vanilla, and blackberries. Smoky ginger and lively char in the lengthy finish.",
"Douglas Laing Scallywag Cask Strength (batch 2), 54.1%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,62,0 to 100 Dollars,"The final cornerstone of Douglas Laing’s Remarkable Regional Malts range, this blended malt celebrates the best from the Islands. The peat smoke finds harmony with the nose of pine, lemon curd, dewy lawns, and vanilla fudge. This is gloriously full-flavored; the peatiness certainly delivers, but there is a pleasant nip of saltiness too. The black pepper finish leads to a long lasting salty smack on the lips. Make this your hipflask essential for bracing excursions along the shoreline. £38",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company Islay Blended Malt #1 23 year old, 46.3%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,102,101 to 500 Dollars,"Fruits are to the fore here, super ripe, and dark in hue: think of plump plums, sweet black grapes, and hedgerow berries. That said, it is never heavy, as if it’s just the aromatics of the fruits which have been preserved. In time, some dried flowers emerge. The palate is equally sweet, with a little caramel and spice. It fades gently. Impressive and well worth a look. I wonder whether the new Dalmunach distillery will produce anything like this? £213",
"Scapa Glansa, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,72,0 to 100 Dollars,"The 2015 Work in Progress releases are the last before the single malt becomes a permanently-available 12 year old in 2016. 6,000 bottles are available. Creamy malt, marzipan, and vanilla on the nose, with pears, instant coffee, linseed, and a hint of table salt. Soft and slightly oily on the warm, spicy palate, with immediate ripe apples, caramel, and slight smokiness. Long and slowly drying, with a touch of aniseed and brine.",
"Black Bull Kyloe, 50%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,29,0 to 100 Dollars,"It’s only right that the first single malt scotch given a period of time (3 years in this case) in Japanese oak (mizunara) casks is from Beam Suntory-owned Bowmore. It’s a fascinating mix of the vanilla, spice, and incense notes of mizunara and Bowmore’s distillery characteristics. You get rich peat, black pepper, apricot, and peach all playing alongside each other. The palate is clean and lighter than the nose suggests, with a fresh zestiness before the smoke leans back in.",
"Benromach Sassicaia Wood Finish 2009, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,87,48,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distilled in 1997 and bottled in 2014, this expression of Dalwhinnie spent a period finishing in oloroso sherry casks. The nose offers honey, ripe oranges, peach blossom, and creamy milk chocolate, with just a wisp of smoke. Full-bodied and sweet on the palate, with orange zest, walnuts, more honey, and fruit spices. The finish is long and warming, with a hint of peat and spicy oak.",
"Gordon & MacPhail 10 year old (distilled at Glen Grant), 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch whisky distilleries, Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar & Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla, situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, Including the UK, U.S., and Canada.
More restrained on the nose than the 12 and 16 year old variants, with green apples, melons, and damp grass. The palate is silky and refined, with fresh fruits, just a hint of sherry, light spice, and a wisp of smoke. Aniseed and drying old oak in the earthy, lengthy finish.",
"anCnoc Rutter, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"The aromas can be split into four; fresh fruits (raspberry, blueberry), desserts (vanilla custard, bread and butter pudding), antique shop (polished furniture, well-oiled moving parts), and stewed fruits (apple, rhubarb, some old orange peel). Wisps of balsa wood smoke; tangy orange notes build, accompanied by those fresh fruits, sweet oak, aniseed, and white pepper ending on black treacle and gingerbread. The finish is epically long; dry, floral, with parkin, residual wood notes, and further smoke evident. (800 bottles)",
"Gordon & MacPhail Distillery Labels 10 year old (distilled at Scapa), 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"After the 68’s quiet nature, we reach Balvenie in fully mature, robust character—well, as robust as Balvenie ever gets. That means more cask-derived notes of vanilla ice, butterscotch, crème brûlée, and a jag of citrus bringing you to your senses. There’s squidgy caramel toffee and the honey is now fixed in the comb adding that distinct waxiness of old, gently matured whisky. The biggest and sweetest of the series. Excellent.",
"Bladnoch Adela 15 year old, 46.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,138,101 to 500 Dollars,"The aim with Benromach was always to rediscover an older Speyside style, and this shows how well owner Gordon & MacPhail has succeeded. There’s a profound sherried introduction, just a little malt, then it is all fruitcakes and light smoke. The palate is properly old-style and oily, with some pleasing zingy orange peel toward the back of the palate. Chewy and medium-bodied with good layering.",
"Classic Cask 23 year old Oloroso Sherry Butt, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is the second ‘Green’ release from Springbank, denoting the use of organic barley, following on from a 12 year old in 2014. This variant has been fully matured in sherry casks and 9,000 bottles are available. White pepper, ozone, and wet sand on the early nose. Ultimately, cocoa powder, baked apple, and sultanas. The palate is initially very sweet and spicy, with salt and fruity sherry developing. The finish is medium to long, warming, with a salty tang.",
"Talisker Neist Point, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,180,101 to 500 Dollars,"The first of four ‘chapters’ under the Renaissance banner, all of which will consist of spirit made since Glen Garioch reopened in 1997. This 15 year old release has been matured in sherry and bourbon casks, and 12,000 bottles are available. Ginger features on the early, perfumed nose, with soft toffee, oranges, and dates. Milk chocolate on the creamy palate, where the ginger theme continues, along with cinnamon and caramel. The finish offers rich chocolate and orange, which finally fades. £75",
"Exclusive Malts (distilled at Benrinnes) 20 year old, 52.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,170,101 to 500 Dollars,"This NAS Glenmorangie contains whisky aged in bourbon casks and some that was ‘extra-matured’ in Spanish oloroso sherry casks, as per Glenmoragie Lasanta. The result is a variant with more of a winter fireside vibe than found in Original. The nose boasts dates, plain chocolate, caramel, and Jaffa oranges. Rich and fruity in the mouth, with more oranges, plus sultanas, roasted chestnuts, cinnamon, and ginger. The finish is medium in length, fruity, gingery, and ultimately slightly bitter. £40",
"Hazelburn 9 year old Barolo Cask, 57.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,123,101 to 500 Dollars,"A limited edition of 12,000 bottles, this expression from Arran was initially matured in first-fill bourbon barrels before a secondary period of aging in American oak quarter casks, which accelerated maturation. A big hit of tinned peaches, then malt, cinnamon, vanilla, and caramel. Sweet and rounded on the palate, with lots of fresh fruit, notably pineapple, plus caramel, chili, and ginger. Relatively long in the fruity finish, with brittle toffee, new oak, and persistent spice. £55",
"Exclusive Malts (distilled at Highland Park) 25 year old, 46.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,345,101 to 500 Dollars,"If you like warm chocolate ganache sprinkled with cocoa beans, dark waffle cones, praline, and brisket bark, then this is for you. A brief flicker of chocolate, smoke, cherry, peppery spices, and chili flakes move aside for a smooth medley of dark fruit juiciness and sweetened char notes. The strident call of chocolate on nosing goes unreciprocated on the palate. A long, satisfying, deep finish of pounding spices. A worthy successor to the first batch. (417 bottles) £123",
"Highland Park Valkyrie, 45.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,71,0 to 100 Dollars,"People tend to moan about Macallan having lost its mojo. Not here. This is a vatting of different sized American and (mostly) European oak casks, so no surprise that it’s oak-led, but Macallan is a heavy distillate and it needs oak to prosper fully. Here you get rosin, marmalade, green fig jam, and the power of concentrated oils. The palate is powerful and supple, with some clove, ginger, and yet more chocolate. Substantial and well worth checking out.",
"Duncan Taylor The Big Smoke, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Maybe not as massive as its higher-strength brother (see above), but don’t think that this is light. There’s immediate grumbling peatiness, mixed with dark chocolate, lanolin, and tamarind, while the spiciness brings to mind tandoori food. There’s still the seaweed element, while the lower strength pulls things into a darker core—coal tar soap, damp moss. A very oily palate, that with water takes you onto the peat bog. Seashells on a fire and more smoke round things off.",
"Benromach Organic 2017 (Distilled 2010), 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Launched in December 2015, the first release of Balblair’s Vintage 2005 replaces the previous 2003 expression. This is the youngest bottling in the brand’s portfolio. It was matured in bourbon barrels and is non-chill filtered. The nose is relatively light and fruity: vanilla, ripe bananas, honey, a wisp of smoke, and soft spices.  Toffee, malt, vanilla, a biscuit-like note, more bananas, and new leather on the palate, closing with a lengthy, spicy finish.",
"Grangestone 12 year old Highland single malt, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,33,0 to 100 Dollars,"This Glenturret was bottled in Douglas Laing’s Old Particular series at 28 years old. After maturation in a single refill hogshead it was released in early 2016. Malt, milk chocolate, and honey on the pleasing, mature, rounded nose. Figs and sultanas develop in time. Smooth and rich on the palate with more malt, cocoa powder, and soft spices. Very long in the finish with quite insistent spice, citrus fruit, cloves, and sweet oak. (168 bottles) £105",
"Highland Park Magnus, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"Released in Wemyss Malts’ Cask Strength Single Cask Releases range. This expression of Clynelish was aged in a refill hogshead.

"Johnnie Walker Blenders’ Batch Wine Cask, 40%,",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,30,0 to 100 Dollars,"ICE Edition is a 17 year old matured predominantly in bourbon casks. Just 30,000 rather extravagantly presented bottles are available globally.  Fresh and fruity on the nose with light trademark Highland Park sweet smoke, ginger, and a hint of dry earth. In time the fruits become more clearly defined as pears and peaches. Full and viscous on the palate; vanilla, pepper, brief orchard fruits, then dry peat, licorice, aniseed, and a lingering, relatively dry finish.",
"Rock Oyster 18 year old, 46.8%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,116,101 to 500 Dollars,"Ladyburn malt distillery was part of William Grant’s Girvan grain distilling complex in Ayrshire from 1966 to 1975. It was located close to where Ailsa Bay now stands. This veteran bottling is mature and rounded on a nose of sweet pears, nectarines, subtle vanilla, and a hint of old hemp. Fresh fruit and lively spice on the early palate, with worn leather and malt.  The fruit lingers through the very long finish with oak, licorice, and slightly bitter citrus notes.",
"Wemyss Family Collection Treacle Chest, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,62,0 to 100 Dollars,"A terrific value blend of Macallan, Glenrothes, and Tamdhu matured in sherry casks has produced one of the darkest whiskies on the market. Inescapable aromas of thick Seville orange marmalade, polished saddle leather, too-hot-to-hold sweet chestnuts pulled from a brazier, dry fruitcake, 100% cacao, and Medjool dates. Sweet prunes, chocolate ganache, cola, tannins, and singed wood spices combine to produce a formidable proposition. Heavily sherried and oaky for sure; this has been bottled not a day too early. (337 bottles, Royal Mile Whiskies only) £200",
"Ardbeg Auriverdes, 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,84,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"One of Speyside’s youngest distilleries, Tomintoul has been a relatively shy performer until recently, when a raft of new releases (some peated) have appeared. This non-chill filtered example is, for me, the best of the bunch. Pale in hue, it has a light, clean floral aroma — think daffodils — with plenty of white fruits and very subtle oak. The palate has pear juice, light vanilla, and a long sweet finish. £34 (Not available in the U.S.)",
"The Balvenie 1993 23 year old, 51.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,60000,10001 and above,"Diurachs are the inhabitants of the Isle of Jura, and this single malt named in their honor is initially matured in bourbon casks before 2 years of finishing in amoroso sherry casks. Floral and honeyed on the nose, with caramel, pine, and spicy dark chocolate. Sweet and oily on the palate, where the chocolate changes from plain to milk, with vanilla and delicate cloves. Darkening chocolate and drying oak in the finish.",
"Aberlour 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"This torchbearer for the Compass Box Scotch Whisky Transparency campaign is looking for your support. A fruit medley of lemon, lime, gooseberry cream, and soft pineapple chunks. Ripe apple and pear from the orchard are given a fresh, spicy lift and integrate with the vanilla and sweet toffee notes. It makes a clean exit with lengthy spices and juiciness, never becoming bitter. One thing is clear, it’s a finely structured dram worthy of your vote. (5,922 bottles)",
"BenRiach 10 year old Curiositas, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Along with Auchroisk, Mannochmore is one of Diageo’s well-kept secrets. This 1990 distillate was matured in first-fill American oak hogsheads and European oak butts. Oily orange notes on the nose, plus vanilla, brittle toffee, and honey. The palate is substantial, rich, and sweet, with figs, sultanas, banana, and more honey, plus developing cloves. Raisins and plain chocolate in the long, spicy finish.

Vanilla, toffee, orange, and spicy oak on the palate, while the finish is long and warming, with more spicy oak. £110",
"Glen Moray Elgin Classic, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,25,0 to 100 Dollars,"One of two initial releases in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series, this is a non-chill filtered expression. A vatting of twenty casks, including first-fill bourbon, sherry butts, and port pipes. The nose is fragrant and faintly oriental, with vanilla, Jaffa oranges, and apricots. The palate is full and sweet, with oranges and lemons, fudge, plump sultanas, milk chocolate, and tangy spices. Drying steadily to fruity oakiness in the relatively lengthy finish. £50",
"Balvenie Peat Week 14 year old (2003 Vintage), 48.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,99,0 to 100 Dollars,"This batch of GlenDronach’s popular cask strength has been aged in a combination of oloroso and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks. Malt, honey, rose blossom, and chocolate-coated Turkish Delight, plus emerging vanilla on the nose. The palate is full and rounded, very sweet, with more milk chocolate and very gentle spice. The finish is lengthy, with milky coffee, sweet spices, and subtle oak.",
"Glenfiddich 14 year old Bourbon Barrel Reserve, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,54,0 to 100 Dollars,"Rich marmalade, gingersnaps, dried tropical fruits, vanilla pods, and cinnamon bark abound on this limited edition, top dog whisky from Douglas Laing & Co, which includes Mortlach, Macallan, and Glenrothes. The satsuma peel acidity settles quickly to show off its tricks of green apple, spices, hazelnut, Maltesers, and ginger. Late development brings out plain chocolate squares, maltiness, and intense coffee notes. Water picks out chocolate orange truffles. Coffee cups and chocolate biscuits to finish. My tail is wagging for more. (4,800 bottles) £50",
"Arran 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is a sophisticated and finessed take on Islay blended malt, which must be Kilchoman-free given the age statement. Driftwood, waxy lemons, soft buttery fudge, banana milkshake, dry grasses, and the gentlest puff of smoke promise calm seas ahead. A silken dram, anointing the palate with lemon meringue pie, honey, and caramel. This becomes creamier, with faint tendrils of smoke and dancing spices through to the finish. Utterly charming and tremendous value for the money. (419 bottles) £82",
"Jura Seven Wood, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,87,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Glansa is described as a “peated whisky cask finish,” with the majority of its unspecified maturation time being spent in first-fill American oak casks. Madeira notes on the nose, with vanilla, honey, and pears. Richly fruity on the palate, with cocoa powder, vanilla, caramel, and mild wood smoke. Dark berries emerge from the background. The dark fruits continue through the lengthy finish, where smokiness increases.",
"Johnnie Walker Black Label Triple Cask Edition, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"Kyloe is the old Scots name for the famous hairy, horned breed of Highland beef cattle, better known in Scotland as a Heilan coo. This bright NAS whisky has aromas of fresh orange, lemon, grapefruit, and light muscovado sugar. It is soft and sweet to drink, with lemon sherbet notes, some fruity piquancy, and rich butterscotch, with some peppermint creeping in on the finish.",
"Hamilton’s Islay, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,20,0 to 100 Dollars,"This vintage Benromach has been finished in Sassicaia wine casks from the Bolgheri wine region of Italy after maturation in first-fill bourbon barrels. Red currants and warm peat, ginger, and vanilla on the nose. Initially, juicy fruit on the palate, but soon drier than expected from the nose. Dark berry fruits and subtle smoke develop. Relatively long in the finish, with gentle spices. Ultimately, sweeter soft fruit notes return. (8,000 bottles)",
"The Famous Grouse Ruby Cask, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,35,0 to 100 Dollars,"This expression of Glen Grant has been matured in refill bourbon casks and is arguably more characterful than the distiller’s own variant of the same age. Ripe orchard fruits on the nose, with honey and cinder toffee. The palate is light to medium in weight, offering more fresh fruit notes, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a hint of ginger. The nutty finish dries with just a hint of smoke.",
"Samaroli ’S Peaty 2017, 45%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,317,101 to 500 Dollars,"Another expression from anCnoc’s first batch of Peaty Collection releases, this has the lowest phenolic level of the trio, at 11 ppm. Initial peatiness on the nose gives way to sliced pineapple, nougat, and spicy vanilla. Ripe apple, milk chocolate, and honey emerge out of soft peatiness on the palate. Old leather and a hint of spice in the medium-length finish.",
"Bunnahabhain Palo Cortado Cask Finish (1997 vintage), 54.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,350,101 to 500 Dollars,"This expression from Scapa in Orkney was distilled in 2001 and matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. Tropical fruit and butterscotch on the sweet, light nose, with very slight smokiness on the early palate, along with spicy, milky cocoa, hazelnuts, and more tropical fruit. The finish is medium in length, with a hint of char. An easy-drinking, nicely balanced dram at a good price.",
"Laphroaig Cairdeas Fino Cask, 51.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Samsara’s (reviewed winter 2016) younger sibling Adela presents an altogether different profile, having been matured in oloroso casks. Like Samsara, it has not been chill filtered. The nose is nutty, with quite dry sherry notes and prickly spice. Finally, fragrant toffee emerges.

The blueberry, blackcurrant, and fresh oak aromas continue on to the palate: fruit compote, raspberry, strawberry, and lingonberry with light spices.

"Royal Lochnagar 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Peat smoke dominates the nose of salt crystals, green tea, pine cones, peppermint creams, and charcoal.

Raisin, date, fruitcake, stewed apple and plum, cumin, coriander, allspice, and new leather leave little mystery about the role played by the sherry hogshead.

"Ardmore Legacy, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"This lighter, fruity, spicy whisky is not for peat lovers.

Malt loaf, peat barns, heavy salty smoke, hazelnut latte, roasted fennel seed, star anise, and sooty embers. This one could set the smoke alarms off.

Delicately floral on the nose, with rose petals, hibiscus, fresh-squeezed orange juice, and a hint of pastry shop.

Fragrant on the nose, with freshly mown hay, gentle smoke, berries, honey, and hot chocolate. Apricots and red wine on the palate, with vanilla and dried fruits, against a backdrop of singed woodsmoke. Nutty and oaky in the slightly oily finish. (10,000 bottles)",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Tamnavulin), 43%, 1989 Vintage, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Aged in bourbon casks, this offers a nose of farmyard aromas, ginger, and treacle. Quite thin in the mouth, with nutty toffee, dried apricots, and spicy black coffee. Dark chocolate, licorice, raisins, dark oak, and persistent cocoa powder in the spicy, very long finish. Quirky, and one for lovers of the slightly arcane. (£500)",
"Murray McDavid Mission IV (distilled at Tomintoul) 1973 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,210,101 to 500 Dollars,"Sweet peat on the early nose, with pineapple, toffee apples, and coconut. Slightly savory, with wood fire ashes. Somewhat oily on the palate, where sweet peat begins to dry, along with oranges, apricots, and marshmallows. The finish is relatively long, with vanilla and fresh oak dipped in hot tar.",
"Tomintoul 16 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"One of anCnoc’s peated expressions, Rascan’s barley was peated to 11.1 ppm, and aged in bourbon barrels for what the distiller describes as “nearly a decade.” The nose gives sweet smoke, with ripe peaches and a hint of barbecue. Vanilla emerges, and the aroma becomes floral. Apples, vanilla fudge, and peat smoke on the palate. The smoke dries slowly, with citrus fruit giving way to oak and chile.",
"Murray McDavid 'Mission' (distilled at Glenglassaugh), 1986 vintage, 20 year old, 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,86,175,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is the second edition of Evolution, first released in 2013, and the ABV has been reduced from 57.2% to 50%. Like the first, it was matured in first-fill Tennessee whiskey barrels. The nose gives vanilla, ginger, honey, tropical fruits, and milk chocolate, plus a floral note. More vanilla, milky coffee, oak, honey, toffee, and pineapple on the oily palate. Spicy caramel in the finish.",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Mortlach), cask #8173, 1994 vintage, 13 year old, 58.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"John Crabbie & Co is in the process of returning whisky distilling to Leith, Edinburgh, but in the meantime it has launched this single malt from an unspecified Highlands distillery. The nose is light and youthful, with vanilla, apple peel, peanuts, and developing mild oak. Clean and straightforward on the palate, with more apple, butterscotch, and cinnamon spice. Spicy oak in the medium length finish. Perfect for cocktails.",
"Gordon & MacPhail ('Smith's Glenlivet') 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"Double-aged with a finish in Ilegal reposado mezcal casks, it has a zesty nose with plenty of bite: lime, cut grass, new bookbindings, grapefruit juice, and lilies. The glutinous mouthfeel has more mezcal influence, with dull fruit, herbal features, caramel, a snarl of pepper and chile flakes, and lengthy smoke and spice to finish. A bold creation, but I’m going to need more persuasion that this enhances the scotch.",
"Cask & Thistle (distilled at Glenlivet) 30 year old 1973 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,100,0 to 100 Dollars,"Initially matured in bourbon barrels for 6 years, the spirit was then aged for a further 31 months in wine casks from the Hermitage Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée. Soft on the nose, with fresh red berries, oiled leather, cinnamon, and a hint of smoke. Rich, slightly smoky cherry and berry notes on the palate, plus milk chocolate and lively spices. Initially fruity, then drying in the finish with wood smoke and light tannins.",
"Signatory (distilled at BenRiach) 12 year old 1994 vintage, 59.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,54,0 to 100 Dollars,"Tlàth is Gaelic for “mellow” or “gentle.” Rich malt, caramel, and milk chocolate on the initial nose, with developing ginger, honey, and red apples. Fresh and approachable on the palate, with more chocolate and ginger, plus aniseed, wood spices, and light pepperiness. The finish is medium in length, with milky coffee, more aniseed, and citrus fruits.",
"Gordon & MacPhail ('Smith's Glenlivet'), 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"This was aged in a combination of bourbon and double-fired American oak barrels. Pears on the initially light nose, then malty, with soft spices, figs, and diluted orange juice. Quite full on the palate, showing more pears, vanilla, caramel, honey, and barley sugar. The finish is peppery, with lemon, dark chocolate, and black tea.",
"Old Pulteney 1990 Vintage (Cask #4931), 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,121,101 to 500 Dollars,"Lemon and lime, grapefruit peel, and vanilla sugar are the most striking
characteristics, with base notes of caramel, milk chocolate, and dry spices to round off
the nose. Vanilla, fudge, and muted peppery spices on a lightweight structure, but it
blossoms in flavor—if not mouthfeel—with citrus peel, creamy milk chocolate, and
coffee notes, leaving cocoa, spices, and citrus acidity on the finish. (Travel Retail

"Arran Single Bourbon Cask (Cask 1801) 1996 Vintage, 50.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Highland Park suggests this is its peatiest whisky to date. Smoky roasted malt notes
on the nose, with singed wood and a slowly developing floral note. Initially, sweeter
than expected on the palate, with vanilla and apricots, then dark peat, licorice, and
treacle toffee notes appear. Black tea and black pepper in the finish, along with a hint
of pineapple. £60",
"Arran Pomerol Wine Cask Finish (Limited Edition), 50%",Single Malt Scotch,86,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"A replacement for the 10 year old Curiositas, this was aged in a combination of bourbon, Jamaican rum, and toasted virgin oak casks. The early nose yields light peat smoke, with hand-rolled tobacco, then tropical fruit and cigarette ash. On the palate there’s stone fruit, spices, vanilla, new leather, smoldering peat, and dark chocolate. The finish offers oak, black pepper, salt, and earthy peat.",
"The Balvenie Golden Cask 14 year old, 47.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,62,0 to 100 Dollars,"Lovely balance on the nose and palate. Soft and gently textured, too. The sweetness of the whisky (honey, fruit gum drops, and malty vanilla), dovetail nicely with light, bright citrus and teasing dried spices. Heather/floral notes enhance the whisky’s complexity. Clean, delicately polished oak finish. A very versatile, inexpensive, easy-drinking whisky. 
",
"Islay Mist, 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"It always amazes me how well this triple-distilled Lowland whisky ages. The best ones are in their twenties and thirties. This one, at 40, is still holding up quite well, all things considered. Lively, fragrant aroma for such an old whisky. Notes of vanilla, coconut cream pie, butterscotch, hay, wood shavings, sultana, dried citrus, and a potpourri of spice. Some “old oak” notes emerging from time to time throughout, with a gently spicy finish. An expensive whisky, but those who pony up the money will enjoy it.",
"GlenDronach 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,59,0 to 100 Dollars,"Antique gold. Aromas of toffee, malty sweetness, fresh mint and subtle oak. Mouth coating, creamy texture-almost chewy-with flavors of toffee, almonds, dark chocolate, and subtle wood spices on the finish. This is a very pleasing, straightforward whisky that is quite mature for its age.",
"Auchentoshan 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"Finished in a tawny port cask. Peat smoke and seaweed interwoven with layers of ripe, red fruit (currant, raspberry, cherry), crisp citrus, graham cracker, vanilla, and honey. Nice interplay between sweetness, fruit, and smoke. (Brighter and more dimensional than the other two reviewed here.)",
"Springbank Oloroso Sherry Butt 12 year old, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,113,101 to 500 Dollars,"Benriach is a lesser-known whisky and, for a Speysider, fairly light in style. This one is very bright and fruity on the nose with aromas of citrus (lemon), pineapple, green grapes, vanilla bean, honey, and linseed oil. Its age is evident, but tucked away in the background. The palate mirrors the aromas and is quite complex. As you might expect for a 34 year old whisky, it dries out mid-palate with some grassy hay notes yielding to resinous oak towards the finish, but the oak never becomes excessive. I can’t remember the last time I tasted a Benriach this good.",
"Chieftain’s (distilled at Port Ellen), 1982 vintage, 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,280,101 to 500 Dollars,"A mélange of sugared almonds, toffee, sultana, and citrus peel. Firm on the palate, with a nutty, spicy oak finish. Nicely done. (Exclusive to Binny’s Beverage Depot.) 
",
"The Black Grouse, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,29,0 to 100 Dollars,"A new, cask-strength Glengoyne without chill-filtering. Both features put this whisky in a higher class than the entry level 10 year old. That classic clean maltiness which Glengoyne is known for is certainly in this whisky. With the addition of some water, the whisky really opens up, becoming fragrant, fruity (cherry pits, apples), along with hints of anise and almonds. A nice effort from the new owners.",
"GlenDronach 1991 vintage, 18 year old, sherry puncheon (cask 3182), 51.7%",Single Malt Scotch,86,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"Amber gold color. Rather sweet aroma and flavors of caramel, light toffee, almonds, and vanilla. A background note of fruit (lemon? ripe cherries?) contributes to its complexity. Its body is somewhat rich and chewy. A dryness on the finish keeps the sweetness of the whisky in check.",
"Edradour Ballechin #5, 46%,",Single Malt Scotch,86,105,101 to 500 Dollars,"Antique gold color. Rich, thick malty aroma with interwoven notes of fruit, anise, and polished oak. Medium to full in body and rich in texture and flavor, with chewy toffee, roasted nuts, vanilla fudge, and candied fruit. Soothing finish, with a gentle sweetness balanced by a soft, leathery dryness. 
",
"Glenglassaugh, 30 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,694,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Dark and complex. Sweet notes of toffee and caramel are spiced with notes of cinnamon and cocoa. Background notes of smoldering peat, oak resin, and clove add intrigue and balance the sweetness. Long, resinous, dried spice finish. (Bottled for Sam’s Wines and Spirits)",
"Kilkerran, 60.3%",Single Malt Scotch,86,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"A lush Highland Park, aged in a sherry cask. Ripe fruit (sultana, apricot, dark cherry pits), layers of sweetness (toffee, nougat, molasses) almonds, and juicy oak. Hints of vanilla cream, honey, heather and polished leather add dimension. This sherry contribution is clean, not overly sappy or waxy like others I have tasted. (Bottled exclusively for Binny's Beverage Depot.)",
"Glenrothes 1995, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"A coastal Speysider, and this is evident in many of the Inchgower bottlings, including this one. This is quite a fruity dram, with notes of tangerine, lemon, and kiwi. Soft vanilla, coconut, and honey play in the mix, with a lingering salty/seaweed tang on the palate for intrigue. Very clean, light, and surprisingly reserved in oak notes, considering its age. 
",
"Balblair 1991 Duncan Taylor Rare Auld Range, 53.9%",Single Malt Scotch,86,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Technically a Speyside whisky, but it tastes more like a coastal Northern Highlander. The foundation of this whisky is a lovely honeyed maltiness. It is aged in a sherry cask, which provides layers of rich toffee, caramel, and orange marmalade. Brisk sea salt notes emerge on the palate keeping the whisky fresh and quite lively-the coastal influence-while deft seaweed and spice add complexity. 
",
"Glen Garioch, 1991, Duncan Taylor Rare Auld range, 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"Antique gold. Gentle aromas of oak, caramel, and a hint of vanilla and sea breeze. Light-medium body, with a creamy texture. Soft, gentle flavors of vanilla, toffee, subtle fruit and brine, with a dryish oaky finish. 
",
"Glenugie, Chivas Brothers, Deoch an Doras bottling, 32 year old, 55.4% ",Single Malt Scotch,86,410,101 to 500 Dollars,"Amber gold color. Medium bodied and slightly oily. Peaty bonfire aroma and flavors, complemented by a creamy caramel maltiness. Subtle notes of brine, seaweed, and a hint of pear fruit spice things up a bit. Gently dry, moderately smoky finish, with teasing sea salt notes. I have always wondered what a peat smoke infused Isle of Jura whisky would taste like. I was also concerned that too much peat smoke could dominate this whisky's flavor profile. Fortunately, this hasn't happened. The peat smoke is certainly evident, but the Jura character comes through too. One extra bonus: it's bottled at 45%, which kicks the flavors up a notch.",
"The Dalmore Dee Dram, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,69,0 to 100 Dollars,"I’ve known Loch Lomond has been making some peated expressions, and it’s nice to finally see (and taste) some product being bottled with this whisky and its sibling Croftengea, reviewed below. This is my choice of the two, with greater (and more richly textured) flavors to accompany the peat. The smoke is balanced (and tamed) nicely by sweet notes of creamy vanilla, honey, gristy malt, hay, and subtle fruit and spice. The finish remains balanced and lingers with a smoky, lightly salty tang. Fresh and youthful, yet still nicely matured at 13 years old, and a nice alternative to smoky Islay whiskies. 
",
"The Dalmore Tweed Dram, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,69,0 to 100 Dollars,"A big and sappy Longmorn, with notes of chewy toffee, juicy oak, candied fruit, sandalwood, citrus and even some distant smoke. The standard distillery issue of Longmorn 15 year old itself is a big whisky-one of the biggest in Speyside with its rich, malty foundation-but this expression kicks it up a notch. Aging 31 years in a sherry butt injects this whisky with a lot more sherry character along with those woody, citrus spicy notes found in so many older whiskies. While not as clean as the distillery issue and its maltiness is somewhat masked, there’s a lot going on here to entertain the palate. And although one could argue that the sherry is a bit extreme, the equally extreme dry, spicy oak notes provide ample contrast.

"Bladnoch 1993, Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs’ Choice range, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Finished (or ACE’d -- additional cask enhanced -- as they say) in a Madeira cask. Soft in texture, and deceivingly seductive in nature. Pleasingly sweet (honey, caramel, aromas of sticky toffee pudding) with lush summer fruit and gentle spice notes emerging towards the finish. A soft, pleasing Macallan with everything in balance. Nicely done.",
"Elements of Islay Pl1 (distilled at Bruichladdich, Port Charlotte style), 60%",Single Malt Scotch,88,101,101 to 500 Dollars,"This refill sherry butt-matured, cask strength variant of the Lowland classic Rosebank was distilled in December 1990. Floral and fruity on the nose. Sweet, with malt and black cherries, plus a hint of new leather. Quite viscous in the mouth; nutmeg, dark chocolate, and toffee on the palate. Walnuts and background dry sherry. The finish offers gentle oak and lots of spice.",
"Hazelburn Rundlets & Kilderkins 10 year old 3rd release, 50.1%",Single Malt Scotch,88,101,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is the second travel retail-exclusive expression of Old Pulteney to use the registration of a Wick fishing vessel in its name, in this case the Isabella Fortuna, a herring drifter dating from 1890. This expression bears no age statement and was matured in bourbon casks. Floral and fragrant on the nose, with honey, vanilla, zest of lemon, and a hint of salt. The palate features fresh fruit salad, coconut, and sherbet liveliness. Summery. Medium length in the spicy finish. £35 (1 liter)",
"Wemyss Malts Vanilla Summer Single Cask, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,79,0 to 100 Dollars,"(Reviewer's note: This is a bottling exclusive to Sam's Wine & Spirits in Chicago, IL.) Springbank bottlings over the past few years have been variable, but improving. The less inspiring ones have been too heavily sherried and/or lacked the classic Springbank freshness, liveliness, and briny character one has come to expect from a Campbeltown whisky. This one is indeed from a sherry cask. It's still not the classic Springbanks we were spoiled with in the 1990s, but it's delicious nonetheless. Yes, there's plenty of sherry (and these notes contribute lush fruit, toffee, and nuts), but the youth and zest of this whisky cuts through it and balances it nicely, with those familiar brine and coconut notes interwoven throughout. A bold and satisfying Springer, with more character that the 175th Anniversary 12 year old distillery bottling that has been in circulation.",
"Adelphi (distilled at Dailuaine) 1983 27 year old, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,165,101 to 500 Dollars,"Powerful, mature, and nicely rounded. Similar in some ways to the Springer 10 year old 46% reviewed below, with the addition of toasted coconut and caramel. It’s also more rounded and with greater depth.",
"Duncan Taylor NC2 (distilled at Balmenach) 2000 9 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"Not all Speyside whiskies are big, masculine, and sherried. Some are gentler, as is this expression of Tamnavulin. The whisky is creamy and smooth in texture, with notes of vanilla custard, honeyed malt, and even a hint of marshmallow and hay. Very soothing finish. This is one of the most polished Tamnavulin whiskies I’ve tasted recently (and going from 40% to 43% in strength provided some extra richness and body). Whisky with dessert, anyone? 
",
"Glengoyne 15 year old Distiller’s Gold, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Fragrant and very clean. Gently sweet with notes of vanilla cream, ripe barley, fresh cut hay, sherbet (orange and lemon), and a hint of bourbon -especially on the finish. An enjoyable and undemanding whisky to drink when the whisky itself isn’t the main topic of conversation. 
",
"Tullibardine Vintage 1993, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"The ""Gentle Dram,"" it says on the bottle’s label, and it certainly is one of the gentler whiskies in Speyside. It’s a fragrant whisky too with a firm malty foundation, fruit gum drops and caramel. Subtle notes of almond and anise helped keep my interest, as did its soft, subtle wood spice finish. Very easy to drink too!",
"Duncan Taylor 18 year old Dimensions Range 1993 (distilled at Aberlour), 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,86,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"The ruby/antique amber color suggests a first-fill sherry cask; the nose and palate confirm it. This whisky is a mouthful: fruitcake, roasted chestnuts, burnt raisin, candied orange, molasses, leather, tobacco, dark chocolate, wax, and a hint of clove. An incredible amount of sherry, but it’s not cloying. The flavors are clean, complex, and well-balanced.
",
"Glenrothes 1979 Editor’s Cask #3828, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,956,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Richly layered. A veritable fruit basket, in addition to nutty toffee, caramel, cocoa powder, and toasted coconut notes, all balanced nicely by oak on the finish. Nice maturity for a relatively young whisky. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)
",
"Arran 14 Year Old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Well-rounded and pleasingly sweet, with ripe red strawberries, raspberry, tropical fruit, graham cracker, white chocolate, and anise, all on a bed of toffee. Some charred oak on the finish. This whisky has a gentle, soothing persona which I think most people will enjoy (me included).",
"Old Pulteney Row to the Pole, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,32,0 to 100 Dollars,"Less appetizing brine and zing, and showing more “weight” when compared to its sibling. Sweeter notes of toffee, fig, and vanilla fudge lay the foundation for mixed nuts, black raspberry, plum, nectarine, and ripe red grape. A soothing dram.",
"Glenglassaugh Aged 37 Years, 56%",Single Malt Scotch,86,625,501 to 1000 Dollars,"A peated version of Benriach that was also finished in a port pipe. There is a really nice blend of flavors here; a sweet malty foundation layered with ripe red fruit notes (raspberry, strawberry preserve, currant) and a firm blanket of smoke that goes on and on. All the flavors are bold, but they're equally balanced. Not a subtle whisky but quite entertaining. (Binny's Beverage Depot exclusive)",
"Glenfarclas Family Cask 1964 (Cask #4719), 48.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,803,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Well-rounded and pleasingly sweet, with ripe strawberry, raspberry, tropical fruit, graham cracker, white chocolate, and anise, all on a bed of toffee.  Some charred oak on the finish.  This whisky has a gentle, soothing persona which I think most people will enjoy (me included).
",
"Clynelish Distillers Edition 1993, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,74,0 to 100 Dollars,"Fresh, briny, and very appetizing. Mouth-coating vanilla, lightly toasted marshmallow, and a kiss of honey add a soothing balance, while pineapple, nectarine, gentle spice, and subtle seaweed offer intrigue. Old Pulteney has great potential if only given the opportunity. Bottling at cask strength and not chill-filtered really brings out more of the whisky’s subtle complexities. I welcome more single cask, cask-strength Pulteneys in the future. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)",
"Dalwhinnie 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Fresh and clean, with notes of vanilla, ripe barley, honey, caramel apple, and toasted coconut. Creamy and mouth-coating in texture, leading to a pleasingly dry, spicy oak finish. Very drinkable, yet satisfying. Quite nice. 
",
"Talisker Distillers Edition 2000, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,83,0 to 100 Dollars,"Stylish, sophisticated. Fresh, honeyed floral, green grapes, kiwi, plum, and currant jelly. Hint of cinnamon and nutmeg. Soft, gently sweet finish. Pleasing sweetness to go with the fruit.",
"Chieftain’s (distilled at Bruichladdich) 22 year old 1989, 51.4%",Single Malt Scotch,86,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Gold color (as its name suggests) with a hint of copper. This whisky, which was finished in Caribbean rum casks, follows on the heels of the limited edition The Balvenie 17 year old Rum Cask. The 17 year old was pleasant enough, but quite sweet (I rated it an 80). This new Golden Cask is an improvement, because the higher alcohol level, along with an array of dried spice, helps to balance the sweet rum notes. Lively, bright tangerine, nectarine, and pineapple combine with Balvenie’s signature honey, nougat, Heath bar, light molasses, and milk chocolate. Dried spice (vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg) and gritty oak resin kick in on the finish, rounding everything out quite nicely. Now if we could only have the best of both worlds -- the balance of the Golden Cask 14 year old, and the maturity of the 17 year old. That could be a whisky worthy of a 90s rating. (Travel Retail Exclusive) Price per liter.",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Clynelish) 1990, 53.2%",Single Malt Scotch,86,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"More rounded, with greater depth when compared to the 8 year old offering. Not as medicinal and less sweet, more toffee and less honey, with more dried spice interwoven throughout. The herbs are still there, along with licorice root. Dry, burning-ember finish. Nicely balanced, which makes it my favorite of the three.
",
"Auchentoshan Heartwood, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,63,0 to 100 Dollars,"Nicely sherried. Rich, with maple syrup, honey-drenched citrus, sultana, and a good dried oak spice finish for balance. Well done for a 12 year old, and definite competition for Macallan of the same age. ",
"The Macallan Masters of Photography 1991 (Release 3, Cask #7023), 50.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,2750,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"When compared to its younger siblings, this whisky is deeper in flavor. The citrus becomes more dominant (glazed orange, tangerine marmalade), with added notes of caramelized nuts and maple syrup. A good dash of dried spices kicks in and the whisky becomes firm and dry on the finish. My favorite of the standard range is still the 21 year old expression, which has been around for quite some time.",
"Talisker 25 year old, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,353,101 to 500 Dollars,"Full sherry impact, but the Springbank character does manage to fight its way through it. Thick, sweet notes of toffee and molasses are accentuated by dark raisin, golden raisin, prune, date nut cake, and fruit gumdrops. Nutty, briny, rhum agricole finish. A Springbank for sherry lovers. (From a single cask, 591 bottles, exclusively for the U.S.)",
"Tomatin 15 year old, 52%",Single Malt Scotch,86,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Port Ellen whiskies are getting pretty rare (and expensive). This one is softer and less vibrant than others that I’ve tasted, but still very much Port Ellen, and still enjoyable! Notes of coal tar, rooty licorice, toffee, dark chocolate, and nougat, with background citrus gumdrops, ginger, brine, seaweed, peat bog, and damp oak. I think bottling this at 46% without chill-filtering, or perhaps even cask-strength, would have helped the flavors “zing"" (and elevated my rating).",
"The Dalmore 1992 aged 19 year old, 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,3200,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"One might assume this to be just a smoky version of the standard Famous Grouse (with its honeyed malt, bright fruit, and floral demeanor). But, in addition to the enhanced smoke (which caringly adds a new dimension without smothering the other flavors), there also seems to be more malt body and oak spice in the mix, which I think takes Black Grouse to a higher level than Famous Grouse. The grain whisky contributes a “drinkability” component, making it a great introduction to smoky whiskies.",
"Caol Ila 14 year old Special Release 2012, 59.3%",Single Malt Scotch,86,103,101 to 500 Dollars,"The variety between this series of single casks is quite extraordinary. This has a soft and light nose with some mint and liqueured fruit, and a big, rich, and impressive taste with anise and menthol, glacé cherries, and traces of mint. The finish is warming and full, with the mint and cherry theme carrying through to a slightly peppery conclusion. £71 ",
"Dalwhinnie 25 year old Special Release 2012, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,300,101 to 500 Dollars,"The fifth peated release of Edradour. This one is aged in Marsala casks. Sweet, with clinging fruit and thumping raw smoke. Youthful, embracing, and fleshy in the middle, with ash, anise, and espresso that grow toward the finish. These Ballechin releases keep getting better. Reminds me of a young Islay whisky without the brine and seaweed. ",
"Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection Balblair 1991 Crozes-Hermitage Finish, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,86,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"An intriguing whisky. Blueberry cobbler, crushed grape, maple syrup, nougat, and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg). The oak is polished and unimposing. Liqueur-ish. A nice contrast to its younger sibling, and it’s more polarizing because of its distinctiveness. ",
"Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask (distilled at Royal Brackla) 12 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,86,79,0 to 100 Dollars,"Visit Springbank’s tasting room and you’ll find distillery-only bottlings of all three whisky styles produced by the Campbeltown distillery. But it’s this malt that will probably attract the most interest. Glengyle was officially re-opened in 2004, and in recent years Springbank has released a work in progress each year. What makes this unusual is the fact that the maturing malt is held in a cask which is kept at least half full, and each year it is topped up with malt from 2004, through the solera method. This year, then, the oldest malt is six years old. The nose definitely suggests a work in progress, and is immature, rootsy, and meaty, though some orange and citrus fruit notes are there, too. On the palate there’s plenty to be encouraged by, with some spearmint and menthol, developing fruitiness, earthy peat, and distinctive salt and spice. ",
"Wemyss Malts (distilled at Auchentoshan) ‘Lemon Sorbet’ 1998, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,87,0 to 100 Dollars,"This hails from the first of Rothes’ stock that was specifically laid down for the vintage release program. The nose shows typical Rothes softness — woolen blankets and malted milk. As it opens. there’s wet linen, caramel fudge, and a hint of mixed berry and dark fruits slowly collapsing into jam. A touch of sherried nuttiness on the palate is followed by thick clover honey and a little crisp malt. The finish is gentle, lightly spiced with a touch of struck match sulfur. ",
"Wemyss Lord Elcho 15 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,79,0 to 100 Dollars,"This cask strength Northern Highlander offers a full and complex nose, comprising brandy notes, stewed apricots, spices, table salt, and white pepper. A hint of nougat turns to darker caramel. Rich on the palate, mouth-coating, sweet, with lively spices. The finish is buttery, with a pinch of ginger, and a final brandy-and-soda finish.",
"The Balvenie DoubleWood 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Melon notes to the fore early on the nose; floral, especially carnations. Progressively more caramel, with Parma violet sweets. Pretty and feminine. Richer and fuller-bodied on the palate than the nose might suggest. Fresh fruit, apple juice, almonds, and gentle spices, slowly moving to milky coffee in the finish. The faintest hint of smoke pervades the flavor, but is very much a ‘bit part’ player in the ensemble. ",
"Adelphi Breath of Islay 13 year old, 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,87,101,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 1977 ‘house’ vintage expression has been matured for 32 years in oloroso sherry casks. Just 240 bottles have been produced. Delicate, sweet, and floral on the nose, with old leather, caramel, vanilla, and malt. The caramel deepens with time. The palate is initially sweet, smooth, and malty, with pear drops; becoming nuttier, with soft oak in the medium-length finish. £370 Currently not available in the U.S.",
"Douglas Laing (distilled at Glen Mhor) 30 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,86,179,101 to 500 Dollars,"With the percentage of former oloroso sherry-matured spirit ramped up to 60 percent in this Dee variant, the nose is deeper and richer than that of the Tweed Dram; Seville orange marmalade and a hint of cocoa. More immediate dark chocolate on the palate, with raisins and walnuts. The finish is lengthy, with plums, black coffee, and a suggestion of licorice. £42 Currently not available in the U.S.",
"Glengoyne 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Comprising 80 percent American white oak-matured whisky and 20 percent from ex-oloroso sherry casks, the Tweed Dram offers lots of citrus fruit on the nose, with an early dusting of icing sugar, then orange and lemon wine gums. Relatively light and fresh, with gentle fudge notes. Malt, toffee, cinnamon, and over-ripe oranges on the spicy palate. Quite long in the finish, with spicy oak, nutmeg, and lingering dark chocolate notes. £42 Currently not available in the U.S.",
"Douglas Laing (distilled at Auchentoshan) 11 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,62,0 to 100 Dollars,"This most recent Connoisseurs’ Choice bottling from Scotland’s southernmost distillery has been matured in refill sherry hogsheads. The nose is pleasing and light, mildly herbal, with cut grass, citrus fruits, and a hint of malt. Medium-bodied, sweet and fruity in the mouth, with peaches, nuts, and discreet spice. Relatively lengthy in the creamy finish. Very drinkable and quite substantial.",
"Grant’s 18 year old Rare, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

Complex citrus (orange, tangerine, lime, and a hint of lemon), honeyed malt kissed by maple syrup, caramelized pineapple, cinnamon, and a dusting of nutmeg. Nutty toffee on the finish. ",
"Glenfiddich 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,37,0 to 100 Dollars,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

What you might expect a traditional 100% oloroso sherry cask-aged Springbank to taste like, with probably the most familiar flavor profile of the four: rich, with nuts and dried fruit, chocolate-coated brittle toffee, plenty of spice (cinnamon, ginger), polished oak, hint of tobacco and smoke. ",
"Highland Park Harald, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,96,0 to 100 Dollars,"The latest batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts includes Vanilla Summer. It is an unspecified Highland single malt, distilled in 1997, and the bourbon cask in which it was matured has yielded 263 bottles. Vanilla, buttercups, and violets on the nose, developing Bramley apples with peaches and cream. Background of mildly spicy malt. Sweet and floral on the palate, with tropical fruits, fudge, and ginger. Slowly drying with benevolent oak, but ultimately a lingering creaminess. £50 (Not available in the U.S.)",
"Gordon & MacPhail Rare Old (distilled at Glenugie) 1970, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,653,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The dark color shouts “sherried!” and the nose confirms. After an initial blast of marzipan there’s rosin, stewed Assam tea, some licorice, hard treacle toffee, truffle, and a charred element, all backed with an earthy undertow. The palate is tight and quite hot, with charred red pepper and a bosky, wooded note. Not a great fan of water — this is about that deep, fungal stuff — there’s an uplift of sweet dark fruits at the end, offering balance. £105",
"Tullibardine 20 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"Young it certainly is. Precocious even, and a pallid-looking youth on first impression, but behind that bland exterior is freshness and life with a fragrance that is very un-Balmenach, all chilled Muscat grapes, melon, even some cucumber. This general perfumed zinginess continues on the tongue, though the weight of the distillate (Balmenach has worm tubs) anchors it well. It’s not about age — it’s about character. Enjoy. ",
"Kilkerran Work In Progress 5 Bourbon, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,58,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distiller’s Gold is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets and is dedicated to the distillery’s first manager, Cochran Cartwright, whose ghost is said to haunt the Stirlingshire distillery. Distiller’s Gold displays a nose of brittle nut toffee and dried fruit, with vanilla and caramel notes emerging. Spicy tropical fruits on the palate, with an edge of cinnamon and ginger. Medium in length, pleasantly oaky, persistently nutty and spicy. Price is per liter.",
"Bowmore Tempest IV/Dorus Mor, 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,119,101 to 500 Dollars,"The latest Tullibardine vintage release to hit the States is another example of whisky distilled in 1993, but now bottled at 18 years of age. The initial nose features cut grass and sliced melon, with freshly-peeled tree bark. Intensifying sweetness with time. Quite rich and full on the palate, with cereal, soft fudge, and mild ginger. The finish is medium in length, insistently spicy, with oak and vanilla notes. ",
"Wemyss Malts Chocolate Honeycomb (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 2001, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,81,0 to 100 Dollars,"A light color suggests a relaxed contact between cask and whisky, but what this lacks in terms of ‘woodiness‘ it makes up for in all-round deliciousness. Aberlour is often masked with plenty of sherry and/or bourbon oak; here the distillery character is thrust to the fore and comes out as being highly aromatic. There are candies, bubblegum, kiwi fruits, and cut flowers. The palate is vibrant with a touch of parma violet and pear juice. Altogether a little charmer.",
"Talisker Port Ruighe, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,69,0 to 100 Dollars,"Last year, four whisky editors were invited by Glenrothes’ heritage director Ronnie Cox to choose a single cask bottling. Being opinionated hacks, they couldn’t agree and so two casks were chosen! This, the oldest, from a refill butt, is for the European markets, and shows hints of rancio: truffle, leaf mold, boot polish, and star anise. The impression is of faded elegance with tannins, fruit, and spice in harmony, and a hint of pomegranate-like bitterness just on the end. £600",
"Adelphi Fascadale 12 year old Batch 5 (distilled at Highland Park), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,69,0 to 100 Dollars,"This expression from the Isle of Arran distillery appeared in 2010 and one-third of the component whiskies were matured in European oak casks while two-thirds came from American oak. Very fragrant and perfumed on the nose, with peaches, brandy, and ginger snaps, plus vanilla and mild oak. Smooth and creamy on the palate, with spicy summer fruits, apricots, and hazelnuts. The lingering finish is spicy, biscuity, and slowly drying, with just a hint of salt.",
"Old Pulteney 30 year old (2013 Edition), 40.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,384,101 to 500 Dollars,"Explorer Jock Wishart’s successful ‘Row to the Pole’ expedition is celebrated with this 3,000 bottle commemorative edition matured in ex-American and ex-Spanish oak sherry casks selected by distillery manager Malcolm Waring. New-mown grass, ripe apples, brine, and a whiff of Arbroath smokies on the nose. Citrus fruit, spices, and milk chocolate on the palate, with sherry lending gravitas. The finish is sweet, full, and lengthy, with brine returning at the last. £20 (350 ml)",
"Hunter Laing Old Malt Cask 20 year old (distilled at Bladnoch), 50%",Single Malt Scotch,86,115,101 to 500 Dollars,"Glenglassaugh distillery has released a number of country-exclusive expressions recently, including this 37 year old single cask (470 bottles) for North America, under the Master Distillers Selection banner. Initially, cornflakes and sherry on the nose, with developing vanilla and soft toffee. Becoming very sweet. Rich and notably spicy on the palate, with dates and dark chocolate. Persistently spicy in the finish, with background citrus fruits.",
"Lady of the Glen (distilled at Benrinnes) 14 year old 1998, 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,101,101 to 500 Dollars,"Recently added to Chivas Brothers’ lineup of Cask Strength Edition whiskies, this Eastern Highland single malt from the ‘lost’ distillery of Glenugie in the fishing port of Peterhead is perfumed on the nose, with discreet sherry, cocoa, fresh leather, blackcurrants, peaches, and apricots. The palate is initially sweet, with fresh fruit, but old-fashioned cough drops and black coffee notes soon arrive. Very long in the spicy, tannic oak finish. Exclusive to Chivas Brothers’ distillery visitor centers and www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com (500 bottles). £250 ",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular Range (distilled at Auchroisk) 18 year old, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"When this first appeared I found it too sweet, which was strange, as the finishing period is in dry oloroso casks. This most recent iteration sees the finish better integrated. There’s more spiciness than on the standard 14 year old, while the fruit seems plumper: more apricot and kumquat. The waxiness is there but the candle is scented. It still clings to the tongue, but there is an added nutty, oxidized character. A marked improvement.£47",
"Glenfiddich Reserve Cask, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"Along with Cragganmore, this is one of the underrated members of the original Classic Six. Quite why has always slightly baffled me. OK, it isn’t smoky, but the nose has a deep, soft, honeyed sweetness: think caramelized fruits, hints of thick cream, and a light touch of fennel and sharp citrus. Thick in the center and very gentle, it’s that chunkiness in the middle that is the secret to its beauty.",
"Glenfiddich Select Cask, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,62,0 to 100 Dollars,"The immediate shore-like blast suggests that the sweet amoroso casks haven’t been overly enthusiastic in their embrace. What seems to have happened is that while giving some date and prune they have added an extra layer of oak — giving a charred element — and, like Lagavulin, hints of tar. The smoke is obscured and the pepper is Javanese. It’s a polite Talisker, but the absorption of the smoke means it has lost something integral to its being. ",
"Bowmore 23 year old Port Wood, 50.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,630,501 to 1000 Dollars,"A distinctive (and intriguing) Bruichladdich, with honeyed malt, vanilla pod, charcoal, exotic fruit, and dark chocolate bourbon balls, teased with suggestions of fennel and espresso bean. Tactile, leather finish. (A D&M Wines & Liquors exclusive.)",
"Bruichladdich Scottish Barley, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,86,68,0 to 100 Dollars,"Duncan Taylor’s latest cask strength, single cask release from the Sutherland distillery of Clynelish is 21 years old. It is sweet on the nose, with hand-rolling tobacco, milk chocolate, overripe grapes, and vanilla. Becoming saltier and drier. Nutty and mildly maritime on the palate, with lots of spice, steadily drying. Spice and ginger in the lengthy, oily finish. £80",
"Highland Park Sigurd, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,202,101 to 500 Dollars,"Auchentoshan has launched a range of travel retail-exclusive bottlings with names relating to oak, including Heartwood, which is matured in a mix of deeply-charred former bourbon and toasted oloroso sherry casks. Soft, medium sherry notes on the nose; stem ginger, cinnamon, parma violets, and clove-studded oranges. The palate features wood polish, old leather, plain chocolate, cloves, and ginger. Dates and spicy orange marmalade on the lengthy finish. €50",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Blair Athol) 20 year old, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,129,101 to 500 Dollars,"This time we’ve got Macallan in savory mode, even a little balsamic. The spirit shows its hand more than in the 1995, with typical Macallan heft. Now you are deep in a forest of yew and larch with a dark chocolate bar for sustenance. Maturity has brought out leather alongside clove and resin. The palate shows a similar tomato note seen in the 1995 cask, with positive bitterness and wedding cake. Though grippy, it has great balance. 285 bottles.",
"Glencadam The Exceptional 21 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,92,0 to 100 Dollars,"Previously only available as part of Diageo’s annual Special Releases program, and now bottled at the classic Talisker strength of 45.8%, instead of cask strength. Initially salty, then sweet and spicy on the nose, with summer berries, heather honey, and an earthy note, plus subtle peat. Spicy and drying on the slightly waxy palate, with licorice, aniseed, and prominent peat embers. The finish is medium in length, peppery, and relatively tannic. £225 ",
"Blue Hanger 8th Release, 45.6%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,115,101 to 500 Dollars,"The latest release from Tomatin distillery is a limited edition (3,150 bottles) 15 year old that has been matured in a combination of second-fill bourbon barrels and tempranillo wine casks (the grape of full-bodied Spanish reds like those from Rioja). The nose offers fruit cocktail and salted popcorn, while milk chocolate, vanilla, and nutty caramel notes emerge. Soft chocolate, bananas, and autumn berries on the slightly peppery palate. The finish is nutty, with lingering spice, peppery oak, and finally a lengthy, creamy sensation.",
"Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2013), 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,119,101 to 500 Dollars,"The most youthful bottling in the Constellation series is a 19 year old, which started life in a first-fill bourbon barrel before being transferred into a European oak port pipe in 2002 for a further nine years of maturation. The nose offers a hint of new leather, marzipan, developing caramel, and damsons. Zesty fruit, allspice, and ground ginger on the palate, along with thick-cut orange marmalade. The finish is long, warming, and spicy. Cask number 18; 737 bottles.",
"Duncansby Head, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is Caol Ila not only in unpeated guise, but from a ‘bodega-treated’ sherry butt. Full and lush, the distillery’s pear and melon here are in super-ripe guise alongside sweet biscuits, mashed banana, and Mars bar. With water, it’s more a cabinetmaker’s workshop—but isn’t woody. The mouth is sweet and concentrated with jabs of raspberry and hedgerow fruits. Who needs peat? My best value bottling this issue.  ",
"Wemyss Malts Tarte au Citron (distilled at Auchentoshan) 1998, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"There have been three previous Special Release offerings of Dalwhinnie, and this 1987 distillation is the first to have been aged in rejuvenated American oak hogsheads. Cloves are to the fore on the aromatic nose, along with cinnamon, ginger, fudge, and tropical fruits. Initially oily and honeyed on the palate, with developing spice, wood resin, and herbal flavors. Spicy oak in the lengthy finish, with a return to the initial note of cloves. 5,358 bottles.",
"Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice (distilled at Clynelish) 1996, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,101,101 to 500 Dollars,"A limited edition bottling to commemorate the great David Stewart’s 50th year in the business and, as befits this quiet man, here’s a release that rewards just sitting and listening. This gives more of a nod to Cognac than Speyside; something to do with the dried apricot, orange blossom, and golden syrup. The palate is gentle and layered, with more dried fruits, which are balanced by an almost jammy finish where, finally, some cereal is glimpsed.",
"Mortlach 25 year old, 43.4%",Single Malt Scotch,86,1013,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"The Old Malt Cask ‘Royal Jubilee Commemorative Bottle’ appropriately comes from one of two surviving Scottish distilleries with a ‘royal’ prefix, namely Brackla, located in the Northern Highland region, near Nairn. Maturation has taken place in a refill sherry cask. The nose is like a damp, empty house, with herbal notes, pencil shavings, oranges, and pine needles. Full-bodied and spicy, with freshly-sawn timber, pine, and brittle toffee on the palate. Citric, with camphor and pepper in the finish. 250 bottles. £50",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Highland Park) 18 year old cask #0074, 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,86,169,101 to 500 Dollars,"This expression of the triple-distilled Lowland single malt is a 14 year old single cask bottling, and just 314 bottles are available. Fresh pineapple and vanilla toffee on the fragrant, soft nose. The palate is lively and fruity, with lemon zest, caramel, a hint of black pepper, and then deeper fruit notes of ripe peach. The finish is quite lengthy, with lingering fruit flavors. £55",
"Highland Park Freya 15 year old, 51.2%",Single Malt Scotch,86,235,101 to 500 Dollars,"It's not often that the blended whisky section can be described as 'the group of death' but at most other times this whisky would shine. It's a very good whisky, rich in flavor and punching above its 40% ABV, mixing creamy vanilla, pureed peach and apricot, key lime pie, chocolate, and manuka honey to great effect. It's soft and rounded, with little obvious oak, and the finish is feather-light, with a slightly fruit sponge finale. £50",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Auchentoshan) Batch 2, 46.6%",Single Malt Scotch,85,101,101 to 500 Dollars,"Ahh, Clynelish. The enigma of the northeast coast. A single malt whose waxy character — and it does smell of snuffed candles — is highly prized by blenders. This is a palate whisky, the nose almost shy and muted: glints of citrus and jellied fruits, notes of ozone/spiciness and stem ginger. It’s on the tongue that it comes into its own: clinging, strangely savory, lightly sweet, juicily fruity. Enigmatic indeed.",
"Royal Lochnagar Triple Matured Edition, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,86,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is a new bottler to me and they’ve made quite an arrival with this, a classic Benrinnes. This is a distillery where meatiness is desirable, and this is as thick and savory as a slow-cooked pheasant stew or cassoulet, with an added herbal and pruney element. A real sweetness and a pleasing lift of sulfur (which can enhance whiskies) add to the complexity. Chewy on the tongue, with earthiness revealed by water. £65  ",
"Glen Deveron 16 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"This veteran Old Malt Cask offering was distilled in Glen Mhor, Inverness during 1982. The early nose is very fruity, with Jelly Babies, then icing sugar and almonds come through, accompanied by supple malt. A good mouthfeel, with the fruitiness following on from the nose, joined by spicy toffee, a wisp of wood smoke, and old oak. The finish is medium to long, slightly resinous, and citric with a dash of cocoa and a hint of peat.  £115",
"Grand Macnish 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,25,0 to 100 Dollars,"Glengoyne’s core range has been revamped: the 12 year old cask strength bottling was replaced by one with no age statement, and this 15 year old was added. Maturation has taken place in sherry casks and the result is a nose of vanilla, ginger, toffee, vintage cars’ leather seats, and sweet fruit notes. The somewhat oily palate features quite lively spices, raisins, hazelnuts, and oak. The finish is medium in length and spicy to the end, with cocoa powder. £48",
"Exclusive Malts (distilled at Glenrothes) 1996, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,86,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"This expression of Auchentoshan from Douglas Laing’s Provenance range was distilled in September 2000, matured in bourbon casks, and bottled in November 2012. Opens very sweet on the nose, with vanilla, peaches, and apricots, plus allspice. More caramel in time. Medium bodied, with sweet fruits, new-mown hay, and hard toffee on the palate, giving way to spice and aniseed. The spicy finish features cloves, and dries steadily, with a final flourish of pepper. £40",
"Glenfarclas Family Casks 1978 (Cask #4004), 41.3%",Single Malt Scotch,86,589,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The last eighteen months have been very good ones for blended and blended malt Scotch whisky. Shackleton and Compass Box set out in a fresh direction and there were top releases from the likes of Johnnie Walker and Blue Hanger. So quality brands from the likes of Grant’s have to rethink. This is well made, tasty, balanced, complex, and drinkable without water or a mixer. But shouldn’t a premium whisky justify a strength of 46% ABV? I think so. £50",
"Glenfarclas Family Casks 1984 (Cask #6032), 47%",Single Malt Scotch,86,1279,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"The world’s best-selling single malt. Isn’t that sufficient to give this dram some respect? It might be me, but it strikes me that ’Fiddich has more heft to it these days, with a sherried element giving the pear, apple, and light cereal of the distillery character a sweet, plump, sultana underpinning. This then adds chewiness to the palate, balancing the dry nuttiness and receding on the finish where those green fruits come through to add fresh acidity. Great balance.",
"Bunnahabhain Westering Home 17 year old Feis Ile 2014 bottling, 52.9%",Single Malt Scotch,86,421,101 to 500 Dollars,"Harald Fairhair was King of Norway and a major figure in Viking history. This Warrior variant takes us closer to Highland Park’s traditional DNA, with the nose offering potato peels on a barbecue; earthy and herbal, with developing notes of heather in bloom and even violets. Lively fresh fruits, newly-baked cake, nutmeg, and ginger figure on the palate. The spicy finish is relatively long, with candied citrus peel and licorice. €75/700 ml",
"Glen Garioch Wine Cask Matured, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,86,170,101 to 500 Dollars,"Elgin distiller, bottler, and whisky merchant Gordon & MacPhail has revamped its prestigious Rare Old range of veteran single malts, many from lost distilleries, and this bottling from Glenugie in Peterhead is one of the latest releases in the lineup. Sweet on the nose, with marshmallows, wax polish, creamy caramel, and milk chocolate. Quite full-bodied, with white pepper, ginger, muted citrus fruit, and cocoa. Soon starts to dry…drying steadily through the nutty finish, with musty oak and aniseed. £430",
"Tomatin 14 year old Port Wood Finish, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"This 20 year old expression of Tullibardine has been aged in first-fill bourbon barrels, like its younger stablemate Sovereign. Caramel, honey, cocoa, and a hint of linseed oil on the nose. The palate is creamy, with strawberries, warm milk chocolate, and allspice. Long and soft in the finish, which is reminiscent of choc-ice. At 20, this single malt has gained in richness and sophistication, with an extremely enticing flavor profile.",
"Wemyss Malts Apple Basket 1997 (distilled at Clynelish), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,126,101 to 500 Dollars,"The first Kilkerran “work in progress” bottling from Glengyle distillery appeared in 2009, and the ultimate aim is to bottle a 12 year old expression. For now, we have separate sherry butt-matured and bourbon barrel-matured expressions for 2013. The bourbon-aged variant offers vanilla, cinnamon, milk chocolate, ripe apples, and ultimately, slightly smoky mango notes on the nose. Spicy on the palate, with blood orange and a hint of peat smoke. The medium-length finish is drying, with a wisp of smoke. £38 ",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular Ledaig 1993 (distilled at Tobermory), 50.9%",Single Malt Scotch,86,185,101 to 500 Dollars,"Tempest to the world, Dorus Mor in the U.S., this has an intensely salty start that’s
like being slapped by a wave on Bowmore’s harbor wall. That marine note
continues: samphire, clams with a squeeze of lemon. Water brings out wet clay.
The palate is equally briny, but with a sprig of lavender, then soft fruits
wreathed in peat smoke. It’s tense and coiled, with real energy when neat, but
it’s best like that, so deal with the heat.",
"A.D. Rattray 22 year old (distilled at Littlemill, Cask #558), 49.2%",Single Malt Scotch,86,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Rich and malty and, though it’ll look like I’m just reading the label, there is
chocolate here: chocolate brownie mix to be precise, with a raspberry sitting
on top. Bold and rich, with a nutty underpinning. Water makes it very fresh and
a little more hay-like. The palate is sweet and liquorous, with nougat,
macadamia, and a chewy mid-palate where that chocolate dribbles and melts.
Neat, it is slightly bitter; less so with water. Very sound. £53",
"Wemyss Malts Lemon Zest 1998 (distilled at Auchentoshan), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,126,101 to 500 Dollars,"As it progresses toward the ultimate goal of an 18 year old expression in 2015, Arran has released a 16 year old, matured in 30
percent sherry hogsheads and 70 percent bourbon casks. The edition is limited to 9,000 bottles. The nose features malt, milk chocolate, and honey, with a citric edge. The palate mirrors the nose with more malt, honey, and milk chocolate, plus ginger, nutmeg, and spicy oak. Spiced fruits in the lengthy finish. £45",
"Cardhu 18 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,101,101 to 500 Dollars,"There’s plenty going on here, but it’s not as vibrant as the other GlenDronachs. Lots of sherry influence, viscous, and a bit sappy, with Curaçao, honey-drenched fruit, raspberry tart, black cherry, and ripe malt leading to a grape stem finish. An enjoyable whisky, but my least favorite of the bunch. ",
"Singleton of Glendullan 38 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 59.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,1250,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Apart from the 40 year old expression launched in 2012, this is the oldest Old Pulteney on the market, and annual batches are
released with slightly varying strengths. Refill bourbon casks have been used in their maturation. Sweet and zesty on the deceptively youthful nose, with banoffee pie, eating apples, and quite sweet oak on the palate. Cereal notes and pleasing oak in the lengthy finish. £250",
"Aultmore 21 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,199,101 to 500 Dollars,"One of the first releases from the recently formed Hunter Laing & Co, established in Glasgow by Stewart Laing, is this 20 year
old expression of Bladnoch. It was distilled in November 1992 and matured in a refill sherry cask. Lemon cake, honey, and ginger nuts on the pleasing nose; fruity and spicy on the palate, with a savory flourish, and a honey and malt backdrop. Spicy caramel and mocha coffee in the finish. £75",
"Wemyss Malts At Anchor in a Cove 1991 (distilled at Glen Scotia), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,159,101 to 500 Dollars,"I always think that having “dull” in the middle of its name doesn’t do this distillery any favors. This is anything but; instead this is a fresh and vibrant example that brings on a Whitmanesque reverie of chewing on leaves of grass: sappy, fresh chlorophyll, coumarin, lime. These scented grasses—now vetiver—remain in charge on the tongue. A rolling prairie in the mouth, and best neat.",
"Aberfeldy 18 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Here is Auchroisk at its more lifted and clean. A whiff of cooking lentils (a lovely smell) alongside lime and cottage cheese (again nice), it gives the impression of a healthy salad. The palate is sweet and quite buttery, with minimal attention from oak; instead it’s all very spring-like, with good mid-palate sweetness. Water dries it slightly, but also extends the palate. Quite lovely.",
"Exclusive Malts (distilled at Dalmore) 18 year old 1996 Cask # 2097, 52.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"Here, a new solera vat is home to a Glenfiddich that has been exclusively aged in sherry casks, and shows its origins with deep, black fruitiness, orange peel, and sultana. The signature pears of ’Fiddich
here are dried and sit next to moist fruitcake. Ripe and long, with toffee, a pleasant wisp of sulfur, and blackberry. An easy-going sherried style that’s ideal for the beginner. (Travel Retail exclusive.) £49/1 liter",
"Signatory Un-Chillfiltered Collection 11 year old (distilled at Edradour), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,67,0 to 100 Dollars,"Another from Glenfiddich’s three new solera vats, here we can see the distillery’s light character turned up to the max thanks to a mix of American oak, red wine casks, and a smidgen of sherry. Think of hyacinth, ultra-fresh William pear, light barley, and grass. Zesty, clean and light, and ridiculously drinkable with a silky feel in the middle of the tongue. Quite a bargain. (Travel Retail exclusive.) £39/1 liter",
"Cù Bòcan Sherry Cask, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"The ruby color gives the port maturation away, as does the nose: all plum crumble, stewed rhubarb, and caramelized orchard fruits. It’s more autumnal than jammy with hints of dusty angelica and only vestigial smoke. The palate is hot, with those hedgerow fruits and a light touch of perfumed lavender before a flock of tarry smoke appears on the finish. All well-integrated and at its best with a little water.",
"Cuatro Series Manzanilla, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"This has good breadth and hints of honey-nut cornflakes on the nose, with the distillery’s sweet, lemon-fresh/floral core still evident, but skewed more toward roasted notes, like toasted rice and sun-dried grasses; even a hint of the felt-festooned interior of a woolen mill. Water brings out meadowsweet. Raspberries lead on the palate, contrasting with the crisp, nutty chaff notes. It’s citric and gingery on the finish, but has drive and energy. £42",
"Cuatro Series Pedro Ximenez, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Heather honey, malt, newly-cut hay, pineapple, and very slight smoke on the nose. Leather, malt, cinnamon, a touch of oak and soft smokiness on the palate. Medium in length, with a hint of honey behind the oak, spice, and smoke. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €150",
"Arran Sherry Premium Single Cask 1997 #217, 53.2%",Single Malt Scotch,86,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"This single cask bottling was distilled in February 1993 and matured for 20 years in a sherry butt. Rich and spicy on the nose: peel, dates, and sultanas. More floral in time. A silky mouthfeel, major spice notes, ginger, and sweet sherry. Long in the finish, with nutmeg and plain chocolate cherry liqueur.£80",
"Bruichladdich Octomore 7.1, 59.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,168,101 to 500 Dollars,"Clearly sharing the same DNA as the 10 year old expression, this variant has less overt pear drops on the nose, which is altogether more floral and complex, with ripe oranges, pineapple, and an herbal note. Elegant on the palate, with orange, vanilla; and contrasting dark berries, black pepper, and oak. The finish is lengthy and slightly oily. £57",
"Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Laphroaig) 8 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,92,0 to 100 Dollars,"This breaks Blue Hanger ranks because it's a traditional blended whisky rather than a blend of just malts. Not that you see the joins. This is a rich, powerful, clean, and crisp whisky with a delightfully balanced flavor of pureed fruits and an unusual, almost menthol quality. Smoke wanders in and out to complete the experience. (The Whisky Shop exclusive.)",
"Master of Malt Reference Series II, 47.5%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"Though as pale as ever, this Lagavulin is hardly in need of a Charles Atlas course. The nose is ozonic, like rock pools at low tide with kelp splattered around. Sweetness comes in the form of cloudy apple juice and a smokehouse kipperiness. The palate is explosive, with masses of retronasal action showing violet root, thyme, juniper, tarragon/fennel, and a finish akin to smoked cheese. An improvement on the 2012 release.",
"Label 5 Extra Premium 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,25,0 to 100 Dollars,"Duncansby Head has been aged in a mixture of bourbon and Spanish sherry casks. The nose is initially slightly earthy; then Old Pulteney’s characteristic marine nature develops discreetly, along with icing sugar sprinkled on apple pie and a hint of roasted potato skins. The palate is smooth and chewy, with sherry making its presence felt along with cooked apples, oranges, sultanas, nutmeg, and cocoa. The finish is spicy and nicely rounded. £45/liter",
"Master of Malt Darkness! Benrinnes 15 year old Oloroso Cask Finish, 52.9%",Single Malt Scotch,84,101,101 to 500 Dollars,"Hazelburn was first produced at Springbank during 1997. It varies stylistically from ‘traditional’ Springbank, as it is triple distilled using unpeated malt. The 8 year old expression has been matured in 60 percent ex-bourbon and 40 percent sherry wood. The nose is fresh, light, fruity, and faintly resinous, with gentle spice. Sherbet, malt, and vanilla on the attractive and lively palate, with developing spicy oak and a hint of pepper in the finish. ",
"Timorous Beastie, 46.8%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,59,0 to 100 Dollars,"The nose is slightly closed, all very delicate, with some hay-like aromas akin to harvest time. This gentleness allows sweet melon-like fruits to come through, alongside patisserie, icing, gentle vanilla, and an effect like Hedione, the ‘smell’ of sunshine. Rounded and very sweet, typical of the distillery, with a lightly drying effect similar to powdered icing sugar. It slightly loses it with water, so keep neat. A pleasant, straight down the middle Laddie. £60/500 ml",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 17 year old, 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,86,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"The richest of the quartet. Super-dense with a note of burnished brass, then light leather and cashew alongside sandalwood. The waxiness and tropical fruit typical of old whiskies is in the background before it moves into lanolin. The palate starts sweetly, with added liqueur cherries, earth, and smoke but for me, after the complex nose it fails to deliver, especially since it is so scarily priced. £600/500 ml",
"Wemyss Malts Snuffed Candle (distilled at Aberfeldy) 1999, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,129,101 to 500 Dollars,"The Old Particular non-chill filtered single cask expression of Highland Park was distilled in November 1995, matured in a refill hogshead, and bottled in December 2013. The outturn was 322 bottles. Initially quite reticent on the nose, then toffee, cardboard, table salt, and very faint smoke. Quite viscous on the palate, and dry peat becomes relatively prominent, with allspice and sea salt. The finish offers licorice and lingering spices. £100",
"Wemyss Malts Foraged Fruit Fool (distilled at Blair Athol) 1991, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,176,101 to 500 Dollars,"Freya is the third release in Highland Park’s Valhalla Collection; unusually, it has been matured in first-fill bourbon casks. It fits into the core range between the 12 and 18 year olds. The nose is sweet, floral, and heathery, with pineapple, mango, and a background earthiness. Finally, vanilla and milk chocolate. Smooth on the palate, with passion fruit, and more overt peatiness than is apparent on the nose. Subtle peat, char, and a hint of licorice in the finish.",
"John Walker & Sons Private Collection 2015 Edition, 46.8%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,805,501 to 1000 Dollars,"A 1996 expression is the latest Clynelish to take its place in the Connoisseurs’ Choice lineup. Maturation occurred in refill sherry butts. Fruity on the nose, with ripe bananas, malt, dark toffee, lemongrass, and a splash of brine. Ultimately, a green, herbal note. Relatively full-bodied, creamy and slightly waxy on the palate; spicy sherry, Golden Delicious apples, and old leather. The finish is medium to long, with lingering ginger. £60",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glentauchers) 8 year old, 54.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,84,0 to 100 Dollars,"Diageo is releasing five triple matured single malts, all exclusive to Friends of the Classic Malts and without age statements. Initial maturation was in refill casks, followed by a period in charred American oak hogsheads, and finally European oak refill casks. Sweet on the nose, with heather honey and gingerbread; slightly herbal. Resinous and waxy. Cloves, cinnamon, oak, and black pepper notes on the buttery palate. Medium length in the finish, with lingering cloves and freshly-sawn oak. £80",
"Glenfiddich 15 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"Sweet on the nose, with malt, stewed apple, apricots, sherry, and warm spices. Finally, caramel. Quite viscous in the mouth; the palate continues the sweet, malty, spicy theme. Ginger and soft fruits in the medium-length finish. Straightforward and very drinkable. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain. £46/liter",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glentauchers) 11 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"With a bottle shape that makes you want to go bowling, this blend has admirable balance between the fruit and the smoke on the nose. The bonfire smoke is matched with aromas of tarte tartin, pecan nut, red apple, and sultana. Smooth and molten in the mouth, it has more weight and body than its older brother. There is citrus, apples, and the late arrival of baked spices, cookie dough, and mint chocolate on the finish.",
"The Exclusive Malts 10 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 2005 (Cask #468), 54.2%",Single Malt Scotch,86,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"A very immediate, expressive, sweet start, with manuka honey dribbling on top of baked fruits, sweet citrus, and a dollop of clotted cream on the side. All very luscious and calorific. As if this dessert theme wasn’t sufficient, the palate lays it on even more thickly, with apricot now joining the mass of fruits. The light grip adds very necessary structure and stops things getting floppy. One for those with a sweet tooth. Recommended.(U.S. only)",
"Glenmorangie Duthac, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,86,0 to 100 Dollars,"The color is light gold, the nose is very sweet and delicate, with a floral aspect that’s not always immediately apparent in Glenfarclas. This is from a fourth-fill hogshead, which provides creaminess, toffee, a little hint of orchid, burnt cream, and grilled peach. Sweetly delicious. The palate is akin to bread-and-butter pudding, with that creaminess continuing. All very summery and ‘up.’ Quite different, but appealing. £350",
"Langside Distillers (distilled at Auchentoshan) 16 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,86,97,0 to 100 Dollars,"Delicate, with some jasmine, lily of the valley, and even, with time, the rich aldehydes of Chanel No.5. This heaviness gives a butterscotch-like quality when water’s added, alongside apple. The palate is thicker than the light color suggests—it’s from a fourth-fill hogshead—with overripe pear and white chocolate; with water, becomes scented with an added touch of marzipan and chestnut puree. One for a thoughtful afternoon’s contemplation. £760",
"Springbank Green 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured in cognac before being finished in Sauternes; here we have a clean, sweet, and well-rounded Bunna’, with hickory-like smoke, bonfire, and ginger biscuits. Lightly vegetal notes with farmyard elements among the smoke and thick, citric sweetness. Immediate smoke on top of this mix of spice, Seville orange, apricot, cheesecake base, hazelnut, red fruits, and preserved ginger in syrup adding an almost peppery finish. Lovely. £250",
"Glen Scotia 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is the first expression from Glen Garioch to have been fully matured in wine casks, specifically tonneaux de vin rouge barriques from Saint-Julien in Bordeaux. The whisky was distilled on June 23rd, 1998, and spent over 15 years in the Bordeaux wood. Milk chocolate-coated caramels, crystallized ginger, and cranberries on the nose. Autumn berries on the early palate, turning to cough syrup, with rich malt and lively chocolate spiciness. Caramel merges with white pepper in the relatively long finish.",
"Ci6 Elements of Islay (distilled at Caol Ila), 61.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,101,101 to 500 Dollars,"Here’s a rarity. A major player in Ballantine’s, this Moray coast distillery is rarely seen in single malt guise. Very gentle, sweet, and juicy start with licks of cream, a hint of barley, and the gentle grassiness typical of the distillery. In time, light almond and fresh lemon. The palate is lightly sticky — Glenburgie for its lightness always shows good succulence — with buttery vanilla, malt, and a touch of toasty oak. Gentle, sweet, and refreshing. ",
"Cadenhead’s (distilled at Caol lla) 2000, 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,86,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"The latest Wemyss Malts single cask offering from Clynelish distillery is a 16 year old expression, matured in a hogshead which gave an out-turn of 339 bottles. The nose offers sea salt and lemon, with emerging green apples and vanilla. Apple tart with custard and a dusting of cinnamon on the palate. The finish is long and peppery, with a hint of freshly-ground coffee beans. £75",
"The Cooper’s Choice (distilled at Ben Nevis) 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,115,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 21 year old from Tobermory is of the peated Ledaig variety, though sampling confirms that the level of peating in Ledaig malt has been significantly ramped up since this was produced. Sweet on the nose, with subtle aromatic smoke, unsalted butter, peaches in syrup, and heather honey. Luscious and viscous on the sweet, fruity palate, with honey, underlying soft spices, and some gentle smoke. Slowly drying in the finish to licorice root and black coffee. £110",
"Tomatin Contrasting Casks Sherry Matured, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,152,101 to 500 Dollars,"A non-chill filtered, cask strength single malt from Littlemill, vintage 1991. Littlemill’s sweet nose is inviting, with butter toffee, milk chocolate, dried apricot, and straw. On the palate, these notes are joined by a nice maltiness as well as a touch of salt. In the mid-palate we get a touch of spice (black pepper and cinnamon) and some citrus. The finish is medium-length and slightly acidic, a departure for an otherwise affable cask strength whisky. (Park Avenue Liquor only)",
"Tomatin Cù Bòcan The Bourbon Edition, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,76,0 to 100 Dollars,"Wemyss Malts has bottled several single cask Auchentoshans in the past, and this 15 year old release is of 342 bottles, provided by a bourbon barrel. Peaches, caramel, sea salt, and developing lemonade on the nose. Sweet and fruity on the palate, with more peaches and very soft background spices. The finish dries slowly, with ginger and a hint of aniseed. £75",
"Royal Brackla 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Pale straw in color, and while it is clean and fresh, it’s also very delicate, with elderflower blossom, dusty florals, and a freshly-starched linen note. All rather discreet, shy even, but effort reveals a subtly lovely dram. Water adds a perfumed, green note. As the nose suggests, it’s not an immediate thruster of a malt, with some light jasmine tea and a little fleshy fruit on the end. Tread cautiously, lest you scare it.",
"Royal Salute The Eternal Reserve, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,180,101 to 500 Dollars,"Mature on the nose, mixing the tropical fruits of age with blanched almond. As it opens, you encounter Moscato grapes dusted with white pepper. Grows in sweetness. The palate continues this theme with the fruits (blueberry, raspberry, and pomegranate) typical of the distillery character, given a waxy coating by age. Unctuous and good. Water rather pulls the flesh from the bones, revealing its age, so leave well enough alone. (3,756 bottles)",
"Ballantine’s 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions – Glentauchers, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Light amber with that touch of acetone, along with marzipan, green apple, fruit blossom, and a runny caramel toffee/crème brûlée which adds width, while toasty oak and ginger biscuit give structure and spice. Again, a lovely, almost oily feel — it’s Dewar’s equivalent of Linkwood — balancing fragrance with surprising depth in the mouth. Water brings the oak into play and tightens the palate. (Travel Retail only) £125",
"Dalwhinnie 25 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2015), 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,480,101 to 500 Dollars,"The latest batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts includes this 22 year old expression of Glen Scotia, matured in a bourbon barrel that provided 304 bottles. The nose offers soft spices, orchard fruits, and a faint hint of ozone. Richly fruity on the palate, with mandarin oranges, vanilla, and a sprinkling of sea salt. The finish is gingery and warming, with light smoke, aniseed, and plain chocolate at the close. £100",
"Arran Smugglers’ Series Vol. 1 The Illicit Stills, 56.4%",Single Malt Scotch,86,123,101 to 500 Dollars,"This expression of Aberfeldy fits between the core 12 and 21 year old bottlings, but is exclusively available in Travel Retail outlets. The nose opens with a slightly savory note, rich and spicy, with sherry, Jaffa oranges, and sweet oak. The palate is smooth and rounded, with malt, nutty spice, honey, and milky coffee. The finish is lengthy, with Seville oranges, plain chocolate, dark sherry notes, and licorice. (Travel Retail only) Price is per liter.",
"Douglas Laing 21 year old (distilled at Highland Park), 52.6%",Single Malt Scotch,86,224,101 to 500 Dollars,"This cask strength whisky is malty in the nose, along with peach, nectarine, and subtle oak. The entry is all malt, the kind of flavor that evokes ""malt reverence."" In the mid-palate it’s cereal grains spiced with allspice and black pepper. The finish is long and slightly salty, with a fair amount of heat from the alcohol, and a touch of oak. If you love the singular flavor of malt, this one may be for you. (U.S. only)",
"Chivas Regal The Chivas Brothers’ Blend 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,58,0 to 100 Dollars,"Cask # 1013 from Edradour was filled on March 5th, 2002 and bottled on February 26th, 2014 at 11 years of age. It has not been chill filtered and is offered at natural color. The nose yields sultanas, cloves, and sherry, plus an earthy aroma and a hint of machine oil. The palate is silky, with sweet sherry, digestive biscuits, soft spices, dates, and figs. The finish is medium and fruity, with dark chocolate-covered candy. £42",
"Chivas Regal 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,25,0 to 100 Dollars,"Mashy peat notes on the early nose, then sherry, vanilla, and white pepper. Mouth-coating, with new leather and sweet spices on the palate. Gentle smokiness and black coffee gradually come to the fore. The finish is medium in length, with sweet, nutty peat which gradually dries.",
"Wemyss Malts Peat Chimney, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,54,0 to 100 Dollars,"Initially drier on the nose than the Fino expression, then caramel appears, along with milk chocolate and vanilla. More pronounced leathery notes than the Fino; fuller bodied and fruitier on the palate, with the fruit developing a salty tang. Lingering salty fruit and spices in the finish, with final dark chocolate.",
"Wemyss Malts Seville Bazaar 1991 (distilled at Glen Scotia), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,129,101 to 500 Dollars,"Full sherry and old leather on the nose. Dried fruits, and finally a hint of meat extract. Rich, sweet, and sherried on the palate, with nutty spices. Medium to long in the spicy finish, with black currant and raisin notes.",
"Laphroaig Lore, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,86,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"This single sherry cask bottling from Arran was distilled on February 17th, 1997, being bottled on February 5th, 2014. The nose opens with a hint of malt vinegar, followed by sherry and sultanas. More floral with time. Full-bodied, with spicy sherry, figs, and raisins. Long and spicy in the finish, with fruity sherry to the end. (U.S. only)",
"Gordon & MacPhail Distillery Labels (distilled at Balblair) 10 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distilled in 2009, so remember this is only 5 years old. At this stage there’s not a lot of cask, but there is an insanely intense smoky, herbal note like eucalyptus, celery, spruce, pine resin, then some angelica and a crisp mineral edge. The palate is balanced between this intensity, big smoke, and Bruichladdich’s typical oily, sweet core. Water doesn’t affect it one little bit. It is bold, it is proud, it is in charge. I like its sheer ballsiness. £110",
"Wemyss Malts The Highland Mariner (distilled at Clynelish) 1997, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,122,101 to 500 Dollars,"What would you expect from an 8 year old Laphroaig? Iodine, massive peat, aggression? Not here. Rather, there’s a soft marine sweetness akin to lobster thermidor, with hints of salinity and tarragon. It builds in heft, and smoke, but there is real balance. Complex already. The palate initially shows muted smoke, and is slightly medicinal, with balancing creaminess. Water shatters this idyll somewhat, as the phenols come out in full force. It depends what side you want. I’d grab some. £60",
"Ballantine’s 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,38,0 to 100 Dollars,"Now listen up class, it’s time for your next whisky lesson. Here the educational blend contains 20% very old single malt, which delivers a nose of citrus peel, honey, air-dried ham, and some spices in the background. Quite delicious, with orange, vanilla sponge, raisin, cremola foam assuaged by plain chocolate, and Black Forest gateau. This concoction is further tweaked three ways to complete Reference Series II. A truly great drink in its own right that makes learning fun again. £56",
"Bowmore 25 year old Vintage Fèis Ìle (2016 Edition), 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,86,455,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is bursting with barley, sweet oak, and all-butter shortbread. There are charcoal sticks too, which add a cool smoke note. The taste is like a warm hug on a cold morning; flavors of butter toffee, orange, poached pear, and ginger snaps, which combine to keep that deep smoke in balance. The harmony continues into the lengthy finish with flavors of citrus, melon, and ground ginger.",
"Bruichladdich 2001 15 year old (2016-1881-135-PHD), 50%",Single Malt Scotch,86,123,101 to 500 Dollars,"With some powerhouse whiskies in the blend (including an '87 Bunnahabhain), it’s a surprise that the nose is so reserved, with citrus, ginger, and honey. On the palate you need your flavor shovel to unearth a core of typically strong flavors, including leather, oak, salt, dark chocolate, and even rancio. It’s delicious but highly elusive. The finish is medium and quite dry. What an odd blend. I haven’t had to work this hard for a blend in a long time. (U.S. only)",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular 1988 (distilled at Glenturret), 45.4%",Single Malt Scotch,86,144,101 to 500 Dollars,"This wee, sleekit, cow’rin, tim’rous beastie is a blended malt of Highland whiskies from Douglas Laing, the latest of their regional recipes to join Scallywag and Big Peat. Perfumed soaps in muslin bags, dried sprigs of heather, beeswax, and Edinburgh rock give this an intriguing bouquet. Juicy: mandarins glow with green plums and Granny Smith apples. Ripe, yellow fruits and spices mid-palate conclude with sweet malt and fading creaminess sweeping around the gums. Distinctive and laudable. £39",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular 1995 (distilled at Glen Garioch), 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,105,101 to 500 Dollars,"Rich gold. Here we have a good example of Bunna’ in full ‘welcome home to a warm house after a cold walk’ mode. Warm, sweet, steamy, with a light mineral note, dried fruit, walnut, and that giveaway gingerbread signature. The palate is clean, spicy, and drier than the nose suggests, but has a soft center. A lovely dram for a chill summer evening. £75",
"Wemyss Malts Nuts about Pears 1991 (distilled at Blair Athol), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"The first batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts in 2015 includes this 1999 bottling from Aberfeldy. The hogshead yielded 379 bottles. The nose opens with overripe bananas, followed by peaches, gingerbread, treacle, subtle smokiness, and vanilla custard. The whisky really earns its sobriquet with a waxy mouthfeel and a little more smoke, ripe eating apples, and ginger on the palate. The spicy finish dries slowly to plain chocolate and aniseed. £88",
"The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Girvan) 27 year old 1988, 53.4%",Single Malt Scotch,86,180,101 to 500 Dollars,"The oldest bottling in Wemyss Malts’ March 2015 batch of six releases, Foraged Fruit Fool was aged in a bourbon barrel. Orchard fruits, double cream, vanilla, and ginger on the enticing nose. The palate is initially sweet and fruity, supple, becoming nuttier, with gentle spices. The finish is quite lengthy, with fruit bonbons, allspice, and prickly oak. (330 bottles) £120",
"Caol Ila 15 year old, 61.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"This second release celebrates Walker’s rare fruit character using 29 handpicked casks combining regional styles, aligned to the 2010 Director’s Blend. Aromas of pear and fresh apple layered over tangy, sugar-tossed dried fruits, pineapple, deep orange oils, and dry peel. Taciturn smoke. Creamy butteriness with red apple, raspberry, and sweet orange yields to soft, chewy pear skins, honey-drizzled Turkish delights, and charred paper. An outlier of JW character but important to contemplate how this adds context to the entire collection. £550",
"Glenkinchie 24 year old, 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,450,101 to 500 Dollars,"Lightly grassy and hay-like, with some wheat chaff. The nose is quite hot, but that cereal note (reminiscent of draff) is pleasing, sitting alongside clean apple and orange barley water. The palate is sweeter and more floral (pear blossom) compared to the nose, though retaining some nuttiness. Has good verve. When diluted, the finish shows real chocolate and some dry spice. A very interesting young ‘un. £54",
"Hazelburn 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"I used to find this a little lacking in structure. Either I’ve changed my palate (or was always wrong), or the solera’s slow changes have added depth and complexity. The nose is all cooked plums, with some blueberry, stewing rhubarb. All is delicately scented, with some currant leaf, then sultana and sweet dried fruits. The palate is equally fruity—more hedgerow fruits now—but there’s grip and a little fresh acidity to balance. Hugely appealing and approachable.",
"Laphroaig 25 year old (2008 Edition), 51.2%",Single Malt Scotch,95,500,101 to 500 Dollars,"The flavors evolve on the nose and palate, with peat kiln smoke, fresh asphalt, damp earth warehouses, morning-after campfire ash, and old boat dock contrasting nicely with toffee apple, crème caramel, delicate raspberry preserve, and dried citrus. Long, smoky, spicy, briny, seaweed, dirty martini-tinged finish. This whisky comes from a combination of both sherry and bourbon casks, and the marriage works. I also like that it retains some of its youthful brashness, while showing the depth that maturity affords a whisky. A delicious, well-balanced, old-fashioned Laphroaig.(Reviewing this whisky gave me an excuse to open a “fresh” bottle of its predecessor, the 30 year old, and here are my thoughts. The 30 year old is softer, mellower, drier, and more debonair. The 25 year old is bolder, more youthful, more dynamic, richer, and sweeter — bottling at cask strength really helps here. Both whiskies are very nice, but quite different in personality.)",
"Tomatin Oloroso Sherry 1995, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"Extreme peat smoke explodes out of the glass. It’s diesely, burnt tire smoke more than campfire. Past the peat, there's salt, paste, and honey. On the palate it's another blast of smoke. This nearly chokingly strong smoke dissipates slightly to reveal oyster shells, malt, paste, and honey. Make no mistake, the smoke is the star and will remind you of that fact hours after you finish your last sip. An uber-peated whisky that hardcore peatheads will surely adore. (U.S. only)",

Pears and pineapple in brine on the early nose. Peanut brittle, licorice, and subtle peat. Sweet and intensely fruity on the viscous palate, with developing nuttiness, vanilla, spice, and peat smoke. The finish is medium in length, with sweet fruit, more licorice, and sea salt.",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt #2 18 year old (batch 3), 48%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,62,0 to 100 Dollars,"This 15 year old has been fully matured in bourbon casks. Relatively reticent on the nose, with light vanilla. Becoming more aromatic and spicy, with tinned apricots in syrup.

"Speyburn Bradan Orach, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,20,0 to 100 Dollars,"Consummately blended from more than 30 different whiskies, this has chewy Highland toffee, freshly-baked banana muffins, shelled walnuts, and faint chocolate orange notes. A smooth, full mouthful of blossoming orange, thick malt, heather honey, dabs of espresso, and milk chocolate. The malty Horlicks flavors prevail to the end with some attractive, shimmering spices. Note the higher strength here, though the 45% malt content is consistent across the range.",
"Signatory 35 year old 1970 vintage (distilled at Bowmore), 51.9%",Single Malt Scotch,94,500,101 to 500 Dollars,"Lush, thick fruit and chewy toffee soothes the assertive notes of earthy peat and leafy bonfire.

"Copper Dog, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,32,0 to 100 Dollars,"Let me introduce you to infinity blending. 88 casks were blended and married in 88 casks for 6 months, then blended with another 88 casks. Half is bottled, and half retained at Strathisla’s Royal Salute vault for the next batch. The process is as fascinating as the whisky. Caramel, toffee, green apple, Jaffa orange, and vanilla pod aromas. Dark sweetness, fresh orange accents: polished, juicy, and thirst quenching, though the brilliance lies in the amaranthine finish. (Global Travel Retail only)",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Tobermory) 21 year old, 51.2%",Single Malt Scotch,86,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Glentauchers distillery is another Chivas Brothers workhorse located deep in the Speyside countryside. Through the aromas of honey, caramel, and vanilla peek barley stalks, hard pears, and hints of Cadbury buttons. The flavor opens sweet, with red berries and Parma violets.

Warm and rounded on the oily nose; figs and peat, before caramel and vanilla develop. Viscous in the mouth, with succulent orange and spicy peat. The finish is very long and peppery, with mouth-drying tannins. £85",
" J. Mossman Platinum Crown 15 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,54,0 to 100 Dollars,"This Highland Park bottling appears in Douglas Laing’s prestigious XOP range, and after distillation in September 1994 the spirit in question was matured in a single refill hogshead (#10897) before bottling in September 2015.

Dilution yields a delicious creamy texture with more assertive citrus flavors and bitter peel showing by the end. A distinctive character from the regular 12 year old, but this should be regarded as an equal. £40",
"The Glenrothes, 1975 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,500,101 to 500 Dollars,"A sophisticated and refined Talisker, if that’s not an oxymoron. But this is certainly true when compared to the 10 year old. This 18 year old is deeper too, with less of the fishnets, more of oak boat docks. Less lemongrass, more fruit gum drops. There’s still that knock-out punch on the finish. There’s a fine line between polishing the rough edges of a beautifully powerful whisky and ripping its heart and soul out with a knife by dumbing it down. This whisky has not crossed that line. A fabulous whisky! 
",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Auchroisk) 20 year old, 47.9%",Single Malt Scotch,86,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"Imagine your nose hovering inches above well-dried peat, then throw in salted nuts, brittle toffee, and an intensification of vanilla pods. This feels more rounded and balanced than earlier bottlings and is the better for it. Warm, sweet caramel, juicy orange, and lime zest are shot through with peat, the rising smoke driving you back while pepper and ginger give close support. The most improved of the Wemyss three, but a bit more heft in the composition wouldn’t go amiss. £37",

"Glen Moray Elgin Classic Peated, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,30,0 to 100 Dollars,"Another NAS Laphroaig made from a blend of different cask types. The nose is dry and lightly tarry—a note that continues to the dried glass. There are medicinal phenols, a biscuity note, then an aroma of fuel, like being on a trawler deck. The palate shows integration between the oaks, lending a smokehouse aroma. Water lightens, but you still get that smoky smear of phenol at the end that tells you this is Laphroaig. Like it.",
"Glen Moray Elgin Classic Sherry Cask Finish, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,30,0 to 100 Dollars,"Independent bottler Gordon & MacPhail offers a variety of Balblair expressions, including a 1969 vintage and this 10 year old in their Distillery Labels series.

"Aberlour Casg Annamh (Batch #1), 48%",Single Malt Scotch,86,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Wow! A noticeable step up in quality than Ballantine’s Finest (see below) with a perceptibly higher malt content. After Eight mints, Rolo toffees, spring florals, clean and creamy, plus some wood combine to produce an appealing nose. One sip confirms that this is gorgeously honeyed, layered, thick, and creamy, with heather honey, sweet oak, and ripe fruits, especially orange and mango. The finish is short, drying, sweet, and the only weak spot in an otherwise decent composition.",
"Ainsley Brae Sauternes Cask Finished Highland, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,30,0 to 100 Dollars,"This was a true double maturation: a dozen years in first-fill bourbon and then 13 years in claret. In its 20s, Bowmore tends to shed its smoke and allows the soft fruits (here, persimmon, nectarine) which have always been there to show themselves. There’s a light oiliness on the tongue. The casks have added vanilla, red fruits, and spice, but the overall impression is of harmony and integration. Lovely. (200 bottles) £350",
"Glen Fohdry Dublaich Speyside, 47.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,28,0 to 100 Dollars,"The official Fèis Ìle  2016 bottling. This is a mix of bourbon and wine casks given a period in virgin oak. The finish initially adds a certain sauna-like element, but then the distillery’s lemon drops and flowers come through, alongside baked apples, coconut, and a touch of smoke. The alcohol burn is negligible, allowing more estery elements, melon, and red fruits to come through. A classic Laddie, in other words. (1881 bottles) £95",
"Granndach 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,24,0 to 100 Dollars,"A 27 year old offering from Glenturret, in Perthshire, this bottling is from a refill hogshead that was filled in December 1988.

Drying in the finish, with mildly tannic oak, black pepper, and a final flourish of citrus. (264 bottles) £110",
"Cardhu Gold Reserve, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"From Wemyss Malts’ Midsummer Single Cask Releases, this bottling from Blair Athol was distilled in 1991 and bottled in 2015.

(312 bottles) £115",
"Clan Denny 2008 10 year old (distilled at Craigellachie), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,59,0 to 100 Dollars,"An uplifting nose of golden honey, linseed oil, vanilla, sanded oak, and wheat biscuits on this west coast grain. Neat, it is mouth drenching. Banana and ripe fruits are followed by juicy orange before a snarling pepper onslaught ensnares the tip of the tongue, igniting a glowing ball of white heat underneath. You can bask in this experience for minutes with each sip. Water emphasizes the oak and mellows the dram to the flavor of almond-sprinkled custard. (180 bottles)",
"Clan Denny 10 year old (distilled at Fettercairn), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,59,0 to 100 Dollars,"Unpeated Caol Ilas have become a regular in the Special Releases portfolio and this expression from 2000 is the eleventh to appear.

"Compass Box The Circle (2019 Release), 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"This expression from Springbank Distillery is taking over from its highly regarded 12 year old sibling.

The relatively long finish yields drying peat, plain chocolate, and developing licorice. £80",
"Tomintoul 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"This rested in bourbon barrels for almost 18 years until May 2013 when it was transferred to oloroso sherry hogsheads for a prolonged period of finishing. Big, waxy, warm leather notes on the nose, then dried fruit and machine oil. The palate is smooth, with cinnamon, cloves, sherry-soaked raisins, and dates.

Creamy, with honey, cinnamon sticks, and green apples. The finish is medium in length, with peat slowly fading and a flaring of spices near the close.",
"King's Crest, 25 year, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,225,101 to 500 Dollars,"Dunnet Head replaces Duncansby Head and consists of 80 percent sherry cask-matured whisky and 20 percent aged in bourbon wood.

Initially slightly savory on the nose, then peaches and cream, and soft spices. The palate is supple and sweet, with vanilla, mango, and passion fruit. The finish is long, with spicy pears. Drier spices emerge and ultimately, light tannins. The red wine influence is greatly enhanced by the addition of a few drops of water. £60",
"Auchentoshan 37 year old 1966 Vintage, 48.1%",Single Malt Scotch,85,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"A delicious and inviting proposition, this offers heather honey on toast, marmalade, dark vanilla, and flapjack aromas. Soft on the palate, there are gingersnaps dipped in thick-cut marmalade and runny caramels, though the ginger flavor muscles its way to the fore eventually. Water promotes more candied peel, before a spearmint conclusion. This is really enjoyable whisky for those lucky enough to get their hands on it. (30 bottles) £50",
"Montgomerie's Single Cask #910 (distilled at Benrinnes) 1989 Vintage, 59.1% ABV",Single Malt Scotch,85,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Speyburn’s entry level NAS single malt takes its name from the Gaelic term for “golden salmon” and was matured in bourbon casks.

The palate is medium in weight with caramel, hazelnut, and a collision of orange and active spices, with the mizunara continuing to influence the flavor of the finish. The cooperage may be arduous but it’s worth it. (Global Travel Retail)",

Excitingly acrid smoke on the nose: like fireworks or the smoking muzzle of a rifle mingled with summer lemons and crunchy green pear. Poached pears in cream, greengages, and peppercorns meet a stealthy, sour gooseberry takeover. Fades to a chalky, sour fruit plateau before a chili heat finish.",

Worth experimenting with water, as lovely candied peel and golden syrup notes peek out.",

It’s an appealing blend of eight Speyside malts, with honey, warm toast, pecan nut, apple turnover, fudge fingers, and orange peel.

It starts off deceptively lightweight, with sweet juicy mandarin before a takeover of sharper citrus elements. Honey and gorgeous silky caramels slink by, chased by a gentle swish of spice.

"The Glenrothes, 1992 Vintage, 43% ABV",Single Malt Scotch,85,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"Lemon meringue pie, flaked almonds, cereal bars, almost porridge-like, enlivened by the tiniest pinch of allspice. A ferocious peppery intensity saves itself for the palate, where it tramples all over the lemon zest and apple flavors without mercy. Once the conquering spices call it a day, this is a sweeter concoction, with soft fudge, brown sugar, and blueberry muffin. In the finish, the allspice has the final word. (Batch 3; 162 bottles)",
"Glenrothes, 20 year old, 1984 Vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,83,0 to 100 Dollars,"After 6 to 7 years of maturation in bourbon casks, this spent several months in chardonnay white wine casks.

It floats in the mouth, dispensing flavors of sweet apple, custard, tangy tangerine, hard candies, green plum, marshmallow, and white pepper. Delicious and accomplished, but there’s an overlap here: it feels like the NAS version had a birthday, rather than the arrival of a new member of the family. £35",

"Signatory (distilled at Rosebank), 12 year old, 1991 Vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,53,0 to 100 Dollars,"Earthy and a bit saline on the nose, like a pine forest in spitting distance of the sea. The palate shows a bit of youthful heat, as well as grilled fruit, polished oak, walnuts, and a somewhat soapy character. The finish is nutty and chocolaty, with structured oak. (Total Wine & More)",
"Scapa, 14 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"Sherry cask influence makes itself known through cooked plums, chocolate, dried figs, raisins, hazelnuts, and sugared almonds on the nose. The palate is also sherry-forward and sweet, featuring dried and stewed fruit, hazelnut, almond, dark chocolate, and light gingerbread flavors. There’s a youthful heat, and the finish wraps up with bitter oak and a wisp of chocolate-covered raisin. Despite the low proof, a few drops of water help this hang together more evenly. (Walmart)",
"Springbank Rum Wood Finish 16 year old 1991 vintage, 54.2%",Single Malt Scotch,85,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Floral and creamy on the nose, like meringue perfumed with orange-blossom water. The palate is straightforward: vanilla, bubble gum, rose petal, orange blossom, and crème brûlée, with a short, light finish of toasted almonds and chalky vanilla fudge. (Costco)",
"Springbank 10 year old, 58.7%",Single Malt Scotch,85,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"Representing House Targaryen, this features its three-headed dragon on the label. Malt and honey on the subtle nose, with a hint of cinnamon. Medium-bodied, with milk chocolate, caramel, and youthful oak. Jaffa orange and gentle spice in the relatively short, spiky finish.",
"Dun Bheagan (distilled at Springbank) Cask #56 37 year, 41.5%",Single Malt Scotch,85,350,101 to 500 Dollars,"This bottling from Douglas Laing was distilled in January 2008, matured in a refill hogshead, and bottled in October 2018. Floral notes on the nose, with barley, vanilla, soft spice, and baked apple. Full-on orchard fruits and more barley on the palate. Soft and sweet. The finish dries, becoming slightly earthy and tannic, with black pepper. (371 bottles)",
"Murray McDavid (distilled at Highland Park) 1989 vintage 17 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"Earthy on the early nose, with a brief whiff of boiled cabbage and contrasting hints of violet. Ripe apples and pears on the relatively full palate, with toffee, honey, and a background earthiness. The finish is medium in length, herbal, with ginger and bog oak. (308 bottles)",
"Longrow, 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"The nose gives off gentle sea breezes, earthy and nutty aromas, then cocoa powder. Pineapple, toffee, and milk chocolate on the palate, with a suggestion of brine. Nutty in the finish, with white pepper and lingering lemon. (367 bottles)",
"Tullibardine Sherry Wood Finish, 1993 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,89,0 to 100 Dollars,"Rosey Mitchell, of Three Sheets cocktail bar in London and winner of the Compass Box bartender competition, collaborated on this whisky with Compass Box whisky maker Jill Boyd. Apple strudel, well-toasted malted bread, red apple, and hints of peat smoke: this pushes in lots of different directions. Light fudge, a well of active spices, orange, and peppercorn with smoked citrus peel on the dry finish. Convoluted and discombobulating. (6,151 bottles)",
"Tullibardine, 1988 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,99,0 to 100 Dollars,"A portion of the whisky that went into the mix was finished in Caribbean rum casks, not the final whisky. The rum barrel finish does shine through. The nose is sweet with cane sugar, tropical fruits, malt, coconut, and banoffee pie. Smooth on the palate, relatively light-bodied, and easygoing, with clear rum notes, fudge, honey, cereal, and developing bitter orange. Cinnamon and oak char in the relatively short finish. Great for mixing.",
"Oban, Distiller's Edition, 1992 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"The longest-standing expression in the range, 10 year old was introduced in 2002. It offers a nose that is light and initially green, with unripe apples, acetate, ripe pears, bananas, and light fudge. The palate is relatively insubstantial, with nutty milk chocolate, vanilla, brittle toffee, and oak. Nutty in the short finish, with a hint of malt and drying oak.",
"Arran Single Sherry Cask (Cask 69) 1998 Vintage, 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,85,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"For the past few years, Famous Grouse vintage vatted malt has been produced but not sold here in the U.S. They were in the 10-12 year old age range. This version being introduced to the U.S. is a non-vintage expression, and I don’t think it really matters. What matters is its taste. Major components of The Famous Grouse blended whiskies have included The Macallan and Highland Park, and there’s no doubt these malts are providing some of the richness and flavor complexity in this new expression. The whisky is quite hefty, with notes of juicy fruit, toffee, almonds, heather, and a wisp of vanilla and smoke. It is also very well balanced and quite a bargain for $30. 
",
"Glenfarclas 27 year old 1981 Vintage (Cask #128), 53.4%",Single Malt Scotch,85,200,101 to 500 Dollars,"Delicate, yet nicely balanced. Notes of peaches and cream, meadow flowers, subtle berry fruits, soft vanilla, and light honey. Gentle, pleasing oak finish. Nice dovetailing of flavors and very drinkable. A good example of a lighter-style mature blend, and quite the antithesis of the Johnnie Walker Blue Anniversary bottling reviewed above. A pleasing warm weather scotch, or perhaps before dinner as an aperitif. 
",
"Scapa, 16 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Ardmore whiskies I’ve enjoyed in the past have been soothingly malty. Many have also been recognizably smoky, which is rare for a Speyside whisky. This one, aged in a first fill bourbon barrel, is true to its roots. It is a clean whisky, with a creamy, soothing maltiness throughout. The palate is entertained by notes of vanilla and honey, with anise, white pepper and a teasing smokiness. The thick maltiness and soft smokiness linger long on the finish. A very underrated whisky. 
",
"BenRiach Maderensis Fumosis (Madeira Wood Finish) 13 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,88,0 to 100 Dollars,"Color is antique gold while the aroma is dry but creamy, with notes of vanilla, marshmallow, honey, and tropical fruit (pineapple, coconut). Palate is malty and creamy up front, with vanilla, marshmallow, and a hint of honey; briefly becoming fruity (again, the tropical fruits) before turning dry and oaky, with a big, long, dry finish (especially for a triple-distilled Lowlander). Lowland whiskies are known for maturing nicely at a younger age. But most people don't know that some (especially Auchentoshan) are delicious at older ages too. As mentioned in my 'From the Stills' column, older vintages of Auchentoshan are now only being offered to individual retailers, one cask at a time, and this is one of those casks. It is one of many 1966 vintage Auchentoshan whiskies I have enjoyed over the past 15 years. Auchentoshan, from a balance and complexity perspective, seems to be best in the 20-30 year old range. Still, having said this, this one holds up fairly well for its age. Available exclusively at Park Avenue Liquors.",
"The Macallan Select Oak, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"(Exclusive to Park Ave Liquors, New York, NY) A rich, clean, bright whisky, with aromas of honey, marshmallow, vanilla, and a mélange of fruit (orange, peaches, lemon, pineapple). Creamy in texture and richly flavored without being heavy or cloying. The various fruit notes dance on the palate and add complexity to the sweetness. Long, soothing finish. Great after dinner-given its considerable weight, but lively enough to have before dinner. 
",
"Port Askaig, 25 year old, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,85,122,101 to 500 Dollars,This one stands out from the other three because of its port wood finishing. Dark amber/ruby color. You’ll discover lush fruit and a rich nuttiness on top of the typical flavors expressed in the 18 year old. Additional layers of intense spice and oak notes balance the whisky’s sweetness and fruit. The heartiest of the bunch.,
"Glen Grant, 16 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Every once in a while you get whisky where the palate is completely different than the nose. This is one of those whiskies. Aged in bourbon casks and 37 years old, its aroma expresses tropical fruits (similar to other older Bowmores), with papaya, lemon, mango, strawberry, coconut, and banana. This is balanced by vanilla, crème brûlée, honey, and just a wisp of smoke. Bowmore’s Islay roots are more expressive on the palate, which starts off sweet and slightly oily, quickly evolving to tropical fruit, damp oak, and then leafy smoke through to the finish. The sweetness emerges again towards the finish, with subtle brine and seaweed. (120 bottles for the U.S.) 
",
"Mortlach, 1997 vintage, 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,85,406,101 to 500 Dollars,"Amber color. Complex, exotic aromas of vanilla fudge, coconut, white chocolate, plum, cherry, citrus, and a hint of smoke and bourbon. Light to medium in body and delicate. On the palate, there’s a brief encounter of caramel and fruits mentioned above. After that, most of the flavors come from the wood-dry vanilla, mint, layered spicy oak notes, with some smoke emerging from time to time. Dry, oaky finish. I am in love with the aroma-it’s so exotic and intriguing. I would pay just to smell this whisky. But the flavors on the palate are less exotic and more influenced by the wood.",
"The Glenrothes, 1998 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"Aged in a sherry cask, and the lush fruity notes add dimension and richness without masking the whisky’s other flavors. Its flavors are reminiscent of crumbled peat thrown over a campfire; damp earth, anise, and floral notes throughout, dovetailing with the lush sherried fruit. Smoky, briny finish. A well-rounded dram. 
",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 1997 vintage 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,88,0 to 100 Dollars,"Quite fresh for 24 years old. Invigorating notes of brine, spice (especially pepper and mustard seed), tropical fruit, and vanilla malt, and an appetizing, lingering brine finish. Well-rounded, and a nice balance between youthful zing and maturity. My only wish is to see this bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered 
",
"Balblair 1991, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"An unusual Caol Ila, in that it was finished in a rum cask. The rum influence is subtle - which I like - and it offers a new dimension to the whisky without blunting that Caol Ila character we have come to either love or (for some of you) despise. Olives, seaweed, fire smoke, salt and pepper notes are wrapped up nicely in a malty/caramel blanket. Peppery, smoky finish that lingers on like the embers of an all-night bonfire. 
",
"Eades “Double Malt” Highland (Second Edition), 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Caol Ila enthusiasts will be familiar with the tarry rope, seaweed, brine, and white pepper. All this is underpinned nicely by soft, sweeter notes of dark chocolate and vanilla nut truffle. Subtle underlying juniper, horehound, and mint adds intrigue. Nice oily texture with a pleasing dry finish. Time has tempered this Caol Ila, but it has aged gracefully. 
",
"“Double Malt” Speyside (Second Edition), 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Light to medium in body (and quite pale in color), but quite invigorating. A flirtatious vanilla sweetness at the front of the palate quickly evolves into spicy, peppery, grassy notes. The whisky evolves further, expressing notes of smoke, tar, chewy seaweed, brine, feint green tea and olives. A persistent, if delicate, honey sweetness hangs on throughout to offer some gentility. Lingering, smoky finish. A raw whisky, but somehow compelling. An excellent value too! (Bottled exclusively for Binny's Beverage Depot.)",
"The Balvenie Peated Cask 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"An interesting contrast to the Signatory bottling reviewed above. While expressing a similar fundamental flavor profile, this one is a more polished affair and not as daring. It is fuller in body, nicely rounded, and expresses a sweeter foundation (less honey, more toffee and caramel). 
",
"Mackillop’s Choice (distilled at Mortlach), 1989 vintage, 21 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Bright gold/straw color. Lively aroma of honey-drenched fruit (pineapple, red currant, citrus) with a rich malty foundation. Subtle floral notes in the background. Medium in body, but thick, almost mouth-coating in texture (a classic Dallas Dhu signature). Clean flavors on the palate-honey, interwoven fruit, vanilla, with a dry ""polished oak"" finish. 
",
"Kilchoman (Summer 2010 Release), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Deep gold Aroma: Mature. Plenty of oak, but it’s clean. Coconut and citrus fruit. Background spices. Palate: Lovely balance and restrained woodiness for such an old whisky-the wood really doesn’t emerge until the end. Citrus and coconut up front wrapped in a blanket of malt, becoming dry and spicy, but not excessively so. Delicate, lingering oak finish. 
",
"Gordon & MacPhail “Private Collection” Port Wood Finish (distilled at Caol Ila), 1998 Vintage, 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Glenisla was an experiment by the parent company-who only owned Speyside distilleries-to produce a smoky, ""Islay-style"" whisky at Glen Keith. It is quite smoky, but without the coastal characteristics (brine, seaweed). Instead, it displays notes of ripe barley, ginger, lemon peel, and licorice stick along with all that peat smoke. A rather straight-forward, uncomplicated, yet very pleasant smoky whisky. If only all the Speyside distilleries did this 30 years ago. 
",
"Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection: Glenlivet Decades 1980, 48.5%",Single Malt Scotch,85,410,101 to 500 Dollars,"Nice malty foundation and soothingly creamy, with sweet notes (sticky toffee pudding, vanilla cream, caramel custard) integrating well with dry oak spice and fruit (peaches, blueberry, and currants).l Very easy-going and friendly. A very nice Glencadam and reasonably priced for its age. 
",
"The Dalmore Spey Dram, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,69,0 to 100 Dollars,"(A Park Avenue Liquors exclusive). Shimmering gold color. Lovely creamy texture. This creaminess comes through in its flavors too, binding to notes of vanilla, malt, shortbread, and delicate honey. Floral notes, citrus, red currants, and a wisp of peat provide contrast. An enjoyable, nicely polished dram from a distillery whose whisky is underappreciated-especially the older expressions. 
",
"Auchentoshan 1998, 54.6%",Single Malt Scotch,85,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Deep gold color. Aromas of creamy vanilla, herbs, wood spice, and subtle fruit. Light and creamy in body. On the palate, this whisky starts out clean and sweet, with notes of vanilla and honey. It then turns dry with spicy, herbal, soft fruity notes, finishing on the dry side.",
"Inverleven, Chivas Brothers, Deoch an Doras bottling, 36 year old, 48.5%",Single Malt Scotch,85,450,101 to 500 Dollars,"A very fragrant, fruity whisky (orange, tangerine, plum, nectarine) with interwoven notes of honeyed malt, toasted oak, vanilla, and subtle anise. I love the creamy, mouth-coating texture of this whisky and its soothing finish. All the vintages of Glenrothes that have been released over the years are worthy of your hard-earned money, and this one is no exception. There's not as much depth as some of the older, more mature expressions, but the lively youthfulness of this whisky makes up for it.",
"Speyburn 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,25,0 to 100 Dollars,"This 1984 Vintage is similar in profile to its older 1972 Vintage sibling (reviewed above), except that the 1972 Vintage expresses greater depth and has more oak to balance the sweetness (the sherry notes get a bit sappy in this 1984 expression). The 1972 Vintage also evolves more on the palate, and it is more intriguing. But don't let this keep you from trying this 1984 Vintage expression. It is still a very enjoyable whisky (and more economically priced).",
"Clynelish Distillers Edition 1992, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,134,101 to 500 Dollars,"A nicely balanced Laphroaig, with a soothing malty sweetness layered in between the smoke, peat, tarry rope, and iodine. Underlying notes of vanilla bean, caramel custard, grist, anise, coconut, blueberry, and a dusting of cocoa add subtle complexity.",
"Glen Garioch 1994 Vintage, 53.9%",Single Malt Scotch,85,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Longmorn’s signature is a thick mouth-coating, honeyed maltiness, which is almost chewy in texture. While delicious in its teens, its personality lends itself to aging, because its maltiness provides a good counterpoint to the resinous dry oak notes which are usually imparted to older whiskies. This whisky is no exception. Notes of honey, vanilla malt, and subtle fruit dovetail nicely with the dry, resinous, polished leather-like contributions from 29 years in oak. Nice long finish. 
",
"Glenturret 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,49,0 to 100 Dollars,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Walnut Aroma: Richly sherried and thick, with notes of nuts and toffee. Wood resins contribute spice and variety. Fruitcake at Christmas. Palate: Thick, chewy in texture, and quite ripe. Again the fruitcake. Very deep and mature with some underlying maltiness. Dry, spicy, oak notes fight off all that sherry and add balance and complexity. Long, soothing finish. 
",
"Glengoyne 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Bright gold Aroma: Rose petals, lavender, vanilla, soft fruity esters. Palate: Creamy vanilla and a touch of honey up front, becoming gently fruity with a soft maltiness. Clean, delicately complex finish of polished oak and soft floral notes.",
Duncan Taylor NC2 (distilled at Imperial) 1997 13 year old,Single Malt Scotch,85,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Straw gold color. Aromas reminiscent of a bouquet of flowers, honey, soft fruit, and vanilla. Light to medium in body but mouth-coating. Honey, flowery fruit gum drop flavors, eventually turning dry and gently spicy, with a polished oak finish.",
"Tullibardine Aged Oak Edition, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"A gentle, pleasant dram. Quite floral, too. Soft, creamy vanilla foundation with a hint of marshmallow. Underlying notes of cut grass and linseed oil add texture and intrigue. Rosebank is a classic Lowlander and, given that the distillery closed in 1993, younger expressions will become more difficult to find (not to mention more expensive). Here’s a good whisky at a fair price. 
",
"Auchentoshan Valinch, 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,85,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"A pleasure to drink, just like the 12 year old version that preceded it. A foundation of honeyed malt, with background vanilla, subtle cocoa, faint bourbon, salt, and diffuse spice on the palate. Light to medium in body, but fairly viscous in texture. However, a coastal freshness cuts through the viscosity, keeping the whisky lively. Some of the freshness of the previous 12 year old distillery bottling is sacrificed in exchange for more depth and fullness. It is neither better nor worse for this, just different. 
",
"Wemyss The Hive 12 year old, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,57,0 to 100 Dollars,"Pale in color, with a gold/green tinge. Exotic fruit (papaya, coconut, kiwi) with gentle sweet notes (vanilla, honey, pancake syrup, marshmallow), spiced with fresh, appetizing brine and anise. The brine lingers on the finish, as do some molasses toffee notes. Dynamic and well-rounded.",
"Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2011), 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,85,103,101 to 500 Dollars,"Aged in a re-charred sherry cask. Moderately rich and sweet on the nose and palate, but clean and not heavy. Light toffee, nougat, Brazil nuts, vanilla fudge, and honey-laced citrus fruit and golden raisin. Subtle brine accents throughout, with a soothing finish. (Bottled for Park Avenue Liquors.)",
"Jura Feith A’ Chaorainn 1976 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,796,501 to 1000 Dollars,"There are still some casks of 1960s Springbank surfacing (even if most are from the independent bottlers). This one is a lighter, more delicate example of the genre. Exotic notes of tropical fruit, citrus, vanilla, linseed, and honey combine with a gentle, fresh brine tang and some background dried spice. The flavors are slightly muted, but this is not surprising given its age. (A Park Avenue Liquors Exclusive.)",
"Traditional Ben Nevis, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,96,0 to 100 Dollars,"Aged initially in a refill sherry cask, and then in port casks. Layers of lush fruit (red raspberry, strawberry, currant, rhubarb, and ripe peach) with underlying toffee and pot still rum adding body and texture. Peat and brine peek through intermittently, particularly on the finish. The whisky is heavy on the fruit, but it is clean and not cloying. A very soothing whisky.",
"Clynelish 14 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,53,0 to 100 Dollars,"The stocks of the “new era” Longrow keep getting older (and better). A pleasingly sweet foundation of burnt caramel, vanilla fudge, and toffeed nuts is challenged by earthy peat, tar, damp barnyard, and brine. Earthy, smoky finish. A nice whisky with great potential, but still needs a few more years. 
",
"Wemyss Malts ‘Rum ‘n’ Raisin’ Single Cask, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,133,101 to 500 Dollars,"This whisky starts with the light and very drinkable bourbon oak-aged 1993 vintage from previous years and then is finished off in a sherry cask. The sherry is fresh and vibrant, and adds lush fruit, light dates, and nutty undertone to Tullibardine’s classic vanilla, honeyed malt, and grassy notes. Delicious!
",
"Bladnoch 9 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,63,0 to 100 Dollars,"Similar in personality to its younger standard 1993 and 1992 vintages -- soft and mellow, with fresh barley, vanilla cream puff, cut grass and hay, cookie dough, and a dusting of pencil shavings. The extra aging shows on the whisky’s dried spice and polished oak finish. More sophisticated than its younger siblings, although the younger vintages are more drinkable.",
"Auchentoshan Springwood, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,53,0 to 100 Dollars,"Richer, thicker, and more lush than the 1975 vintage reviewed here. Fallen orchard fruit, sticky toffee pudding, and nuts, with underlying suggestions of date cake. Emerging dried spice and oak resin towards the finish. A good contrast to the 1975 vintage.",
"The Macallan Masters of Photography 1996 (Release 3, Cask #10019), 55.5%",Single Malt Scotch,85,2750,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Predominantly fruity -- the sherry cask is obvious, but it’s not heavy or dominant. Clean, bright orchard fruit blends in nicely with strawberry rhubarb pie, light toffee, dates, dark chocolate, and polished oak. Long, soothing, oily finish. Another solid effort from this young distillery.",
"Glen Garioch Vintage 1997, 56.7%",Single Malt Scotch,85,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"When I toured Glenfarclas in May 2008, George Grant told me that, while it is usually not their policy to stray from aging their whisky in sherry and bourbon oak casks, they have done some experimenting. One of these experiments, aged entirely in a port cask, has finally been bottled. The nice thing about Glenfarclas is that it is a rich spirit and can stand up to a good dose of port wine (or sherry for that matter). The port notes are lush, with ripe fruit (plum, red grape skin, caramelized apricot, prune) and dates complementing the whisky’s malty, maple syrup foundation. The 27 years also impart a good dose of polished oak for balance. Not as complex as other Glenfarclas whiskies of this age, but this is certainly a solid, enjoyable change of pace for Glenfarclas. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)",
"Wemyss Malts (distilled at Clynelish) “A Day at the Coast” 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,105,101 to 500 Dollars,"A soft, easy-going whisky with a foundation of honeyed vanilla, caramel custard, and mouth-coating maltiness. Floral and brine notes are sprinkled throughout, as are cocoa, white pepper, and subtle edible seaweed. Soft malt and brine finish. A whisky with a gentler personality when compared to most other island malts, making it a nice introduction to the style. I would, however, like to see this whisky bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered. I’d be more than willing to sacrifice some drinkability for greater intensity and more subtle nuances. Still, it is an enjoyable whisky, and enthusiasts of its predecessor -- Scapa 14 -- should also like it, albeit at a higher retail price.",
"The Dalmore 1980 31 year old, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,85,6400,5001 to 10000 Dollars,"Sounds more like a disease than a whisky. A peated version of BenRiach, with the tarry smoke melding nicely with toffee, bramble, and rhubarb. Lingering earthy smoke on the finish and slightly tannic, with subtle fruit. Good mouthfeel on this one.",
"Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask (distilled at Rosebank) 21 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,85,212,101 to 500 Dollars,"Straw gold. Well rounded, with fresh vanilla, berries in cream, caramel custard, toasted oak, and gentle dried spice. A really nice everyday, anytime dram. The best price/quality ratio of the range. (Price is per 1 liter.)",
"Wemyss Malts (distilled at Glen Scotia) 'Strawberry Ganache,' 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,174,101 to 500 Dollars,"Still in the same vein as its 17 year old sibling reviewed above, but it’s softer, mellower, with more wood impact (especially on the nose and back end of the palate) and tea leaves. Perhaps even some mild tobacco. Darker sugars in this one (molasses?) rather than honey, and more berried fruit along with the citrus, which struggles to reveal itself. Dry, resinous finish. An enjoyable dram, even if the wood outstays its welcome. But if you have to pick between the two expressions, go for the 17 year old and pocket the change with a smile on your face. Price: £75",
"Glen Scotia 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Thicker and fruitier than the entry level 10 year old, with greater mouthfeel and a drier finish. Orchard fruit (especially pear), kiwi, lime, and creamy vanilla, with suggestions of toasted coconut, hay, and marshmallow. Dry, gently spicy finish. A bit more involved than the 10 year old, but still with the same DNA. Very pleasant.
",
"Glen Scotia 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,67,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured in a bourbon cask. Thick and creamy, with mouth-coating vanilla, ripe barley, toasted marshmallow, vanilla wafer, key lime pie, golden delicious apple, lemongrass, and hay. The vanilla sweetness lingers to the finish, mixing with dried herbs and hay. I was expecting more from a carefully chosen Mortlach, given its pedigree, but this is still nice. (240 bottles) £250",
"Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2012), 56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,85,111,101 to 500 Dollars,"One thing I enjoy about these vintage releases are the differences in personality from one vintage to the next. This 1998 vintage follows shortly after the 1994, and while that one was elegant and bright in personality, this 1998 is more viscous and heavier in weight. It shows bright fruit (lemon, caramelized pineapple, tangerine), honeyed vanilla, and marzipan with a peppering of cinnamon and ginger. Perhaps the 1994 as an aperitif, and the 1998 a digestif? The 1998 is not nearly as post-prandial as, say, the 1972 vintage, but it has more weight than the 1994 vintage. Still, if I had to choose between the 1994 and 1998, my nod goes to the 1994 for its elegance and drinkability.",
"Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Arran) 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,63,0 to 100 Dollars,"More mature peated Bunnahabhain Islay whiskies are emerging (like this one). Indeed, tarry, peat ash notes are evident throughout this one (especially on the finish!), along with nutty toffee, nougat, smoked olive, glazed ginger, and candied lime. Pretty even-keeled, not as medicinal and aggressive as its cousins on the southern end of the island. The smoke and layered sweet notes balance nicely. If you’re looking to ease your way into smoky Islay whiskies, this would be a good start.",
"Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection Ledaig 1993 St-Joseph Wood Finish, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,85,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"Here’s the older sibling to the 1997 vintage released in U.S. at the same time. It costs twice as much as the 1997 vintage, and guess what? I like the less expensive 1997 vintage better (because of its lovely balance and creamy texture). Still, this 1991 vintage is a nice whisky, rich with vanilla, coconut cream, citrus (orange, tangerine), pineapple, and sultana. A soothing, mouth-coating texture lingers, with some polished oak on the finish.",
"Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask (distilled at Highland Park) 15 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,85,111,101 to 500 Dollars,"Consists of two whiskies: half 10 year old Clynelish (finished in Chateau Lafite casks) and half 10 year old Ben Nevis (finished in Grenache Blanc casks). The classic chewy, nutty toffee notes of Ben Nevis are prominent throughout, while Clynelish’s spicy, briny notes become more prominent mid-palate, peaking on the finish. The two work well together, with the brine and spice cutting through the thick toffee. Bright, berried fruit (from the finishing) adds an additional dimension prominently throughout. Some oak resin kicks in on the finish to keep the whisky from becoming too sappy sweet.",
"Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Blair Athol) 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,63,0 to 100 Dollars,"This “double malt” contains 70% 12 year old Dufftown (finished in a Zinfandel cask) and 30% 15 year old Mortlach (finished in a Callejo cask). This is a rich, fruity, gripping, broad-shouldered Speyside whisky. Richly sherried, with thick, layered sweetness as a foundation (honey, caramel, light toffee), along with ripe bramble, golden raisin, and pit fruit. Leather, tobacco-tinged, oak tannin finish.",
"Wemyss Malts (distilled at Clynelish) “A Day at the Coast” 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"The newest release in Balvenie’s limited edition range, and the first venture back into smoke since the “Islay Cask” limited release several years ago. Some of this whisky was finished in a peated cask, some in new American oak. Both influences emerge with the smoke (jerky with a hint of kippers) and spice (cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg) on a foundation of honeyed malt. Spicy, smoky finish. Balvenie is one of those big Speyside whiskies that can stand up to the smoke. This one will not appeal to everyone, but it makes for an interesting diversion.",
"Littlemill 21 year old Burns Malt, 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,85,72,0 to 100 Dollars,"Certainly not the best Mortlach I’ve tasted, but it’s a solid effort and at a good price for a 21 year old. Nicely balanced — Lorne Mackillop’s hallmark — and somewhat reserved, too (for a Mortlach), with intriguing lime, kiwi, caramel, floral notes (on the nose), nutty toffee (especially on the palate), soaked barley, and charcoal, with a rather syrupy, mouth-clinging texture toward the finish. Worth a look.",
"Douglas Laing (distilled at Glenturret) 18 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,85,124,101 to 500 Dollars,"This young distillery’s fourth release, aged entirely in bourbon barrels. (This is the first one available in the U.S.) The two previous releases that I tasted and reviewed (the inaugural release and the Autumn 2009 release) were finished in sherry casks. I miss the sherry, to be honest. I think it softened the whisky, added a new dimension, and perhaps even masked some of the youth. Still, this is a very nice effort: brisk, vibrant, and bracing, with plenty of raw peat smoke and tar, along with pear, citrus, vanilla, licorice root, bourbon barrel char, clove, bitter chocolate, and suggestions of olive brine and high-end mescal.",
"Auchentoshan Valinch 2012, 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,85,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Sweet, viscous, and weighty; much more so than its sister whisky (reviewed above) that was finished in Madeira casks. But the same Caol Ila DNA is here — tar, olive brine, pepper — along with fleshy red fruit and chocolate. Lingering ripe fruit and tar on the finish. Save this one for after dinner, or with a book at bedtime.",
"Cardhu 12 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,85,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. This is from a first fill American oak hoggie, and the extra time in cask has given it a classic mature Glenlivet character: a rich, complex mix of cooked apple, pine, and citrus, cut with rose petal. The fruitiness has moved from pear into baked apricot. Water adds an almond note. The scented notes have been retained (especially on the finish), but have deepened into sweet spice. The oak gives light grip. Have with chilled water on the side. £250",
"Glenlivet 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,33,0 to 100 Dollars,"The Spey Dram is made up of 36 percent whisky matured in ex-oloroso casks and 64 percent from American oak. The nose offers fresh oranges, brittle toffee, cream, and ginger. The nutty palate reveals fresh fruits, and is significantly spicier than the other Rivers expressions, with ginger and even chili notes. The finish is long and notably spicy, with less chocolate than in the three other Rivers variants, ending with a touch of treacle. £42 Currently not available in the U.S.",
"Wemyss Malts Fruit Bonbons (distilled at Glen Garioch) 1989, 66%",Single Malt Scotch,85,137,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 1998 vintage triple distilled Lowland Auchentoshan has been matured in fino sherry casks, which are rarely used for Scotch whisky maturation. The nose presents violets in fresh soil, honey, spice, developing citric fruit notes, and almonds. Quite full-bodied, fruity and zesty in the mouth. Lengthy in the finish, with spice, nuts, and oak. Becoming dry and gingery at the last.",
"Douglas Laing Director’s Cut (distilled at Teaninich) 1982, 47.8%",Single Malt Scotch,85,297,101 to 500 Dollars,"This veteran Lowland Inverleven — distilled within the now decommissioned Dumbarton grain distillery complex — is a recent addition to Chivas Brothers’ Cask Strength Edition series, and is exclusively available at distillery visitor centers and from www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com. The nose is creamy, gentle, and sweet, with vanilla, rum raisin ice cream, and a subtle, contrasting peppery note. Mouth-coating, with citrus fruits and slowly developing dark chocolate, which lingers through the long and gingery finish. (500 bottles). Currently not available in the U.S. £275 ",
"Tullibardine 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,250,101 to 500 Dollars,"Okay, how many of you have walked past this one thinking the price is just too crazily low for the liquid to be any good? How many have started your whisky life with this and then set it aside? Time to rethink. Speyburn, one of the forgotten distilleries of Rothes, is a charmer. Sweet and fragrant with notes of blossom and a little red fruit on the nose, the palate shows ginger, cream, and rhubarb. (Value Pick)",
"Creative Whisky Co. Exclusive Malts (distilled at Littlemill) 24 year old, 49.8%",Single Malt Scotch,85,165,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 1992 vintage from Clynelish distillery is part of Diageo’s Distillers Edition range of ‘finished’ single malts, and it underwent a secondary period of maturation in oloroso seco casks prior to bottling. Sweet sherry, honey, and oranges on the nose, with a gentle note of rum and cloves. The palate initially offers vibrant sherry, sultana, and hazelnuts, with developing cloves, angelica, and spices. The finish is medium in length, with a mild note of enduring ginger. £45 (Not available in the U.S.)",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt, 54%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,76,0 to 100 Dollars,"The latest release from Glen Garioch is a limited edition 1994 vintage, produced when the distillery still boasted working floor maltings, and is therefore more peaty than spirit subsequently distilled. Pear drops, vanilla, and developing caramel on the nose. Freshly-opened cigarette packets, and, in time, brown paper and vinegar. Quite dry and austere on the palate, with stem ginger and subtle smoke. Persistently spicy in the medium-length finish, with an elusive late flurry of smoky, chocolate caramel. ",
"That Boutique-y Springbank Batch 2, 53.10%",Single Malt Scotch,85,89,0 to 100 Dollars,"This 10 year old expression from the Perthshire distillery of Glenturret has replaced the 12 year old. Glenturret is at the heart of The Famous Grouse blend, and the distillery was re-branded as ‘The Famous Grouse Experience’ in 2002. Nutty and slightly oily on the nose, with barley and citrus fruits. Sweet and honeyed on the full, fruity palate, with a balancing note of oak. Medium length in the sweet finish. £31 (Not available in the U.S.)",
"Jura Turas-Mara, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,85,61,0 to 100 Dollars,"Glengoyne’s entry-level 10 year old is the most readily available of their malts, and is made using entirely unpeated malt. The producers claim this helps to preserve “the essence of its flavor.” Fresh and well-rounded on the nose, with medium sweet aromas suggesting malt, oak, and a hint of sherry. Smooth and delicate on the palate, it is slightly oaky, with a suggestion of cooking apples. The finish is pleasingly long, with buttery, vanilla notes, slowly drying.",
"Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Glen Garioch) 17 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,92,0 to 100 Dollars,"Pale straw. One of a seemingly never-ending stream of Imperials from Duncan Taylor, all of which show remarkable consistency and are rarely over-wooded, thereby allowing the distillery character to shine. Here are echoes of Loire Sauvignon Blanc — nettles, gooseberry, cut grass, fennel tops, and fresh herbs — with a hint of Imperial’s giveaway American cream soda softness. The palate is as soft as soy milk. Classic Imperial.£38",
"Wemyss Malts Candied Fruit (distilled at Auchentoshan) 1998, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"Tullibardine Aged Oak Edition carries no age statement, though it contains a blend of whisky more than 15 years old and spirit produced since the distillery reopened in 2003. It has been matured in former bourbon barrels. The nose exhibits barley, citrus fruits, pear drops, crystallized ginger, marzipan, and cocoa. Oily in the mouth and slightly earthy, with brazil nuts and developing vanilla fudge and lemon on the palate. Fruitiness persists through the spicy finish. ",
"Shieldaig 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,31,0 to 100 Dollars,"Auchentoshan Valinch is essentially a cask strength version of the popular Classic expression. It is named after the metal tube used to extract samples of spirit from the cask. A nose of tinned peaches in syrup, Madeira, cinnamon, newly-planed wood, coconut, and vanilla notes. Sweet and spicy on the creamy palate, with vanilla, honey, and praline. Oak and spice in the peach liqueur-like finish.",
"James Brookes Blended Whisky, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,18,0 to 100 Dollars,"Wemyss has picked up where The Easy Drinking Whisky Company left off a few years back and are selling their mix of malt whiskies under a descriptive flavor name. This is the best the company has done so far. It is a delightfully soft, fruity, and dessert-like whisky with, yes, lashings of honeyed malt to make it a soft, succulent treat of a whisky. Wemyss comes of age.  £36",
"Cadenhead’s (distilled at	 Auchroisk) 12 year old, 59.3%",Single Malt Scotch,85,92,0 to 100 Dollars,"Brought back as an annual limited edition to satisfy the cravings of those who like their peat full-on and never understood why Lagavulin moved to 16 years of age, this is the Kildalton coast single malt at its most boisterous. Aromatically, it blazes a seaweed-strewn, zigzag pathway between sea, shore, and land: bog myrtle and samphire, beach bonfire, sea spray, and melon before, with much-needed water, there’s slow-burning Latakia pipe tobacco and Lapsang Souchong tea.",
"Tomatin Cù Bòcan, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"The name of this limited-edition bottling translates as ‘the lands around the rowan,’ and the component whisky has been matured in three, fresh-run American white oak hogsheads. Tinned peaches, a hint of smoke, and developing cream soda on the nose. Soft toffee and ultimately, chimney soot. The palate is full and fruity, with Brazil nuts, drying quite rapidly, with coriander notes. Dark chocolate and licorice characterize the finish. (500 bottles). £500",
"Glen Garioch Virgin Oak, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,85,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"An attempt to replicate the spirit produced at Ben Nevis in 1882. The malt is peated to around 30 ppm, and a first edition of 700 bottles with no age statement has been released. Initial starch on the nose, then buttery smoked haddock, a hint of chili, sherry, and gentle wood smoke. Full-bodied, spicy on the palate, with hazelnuts and peat. Stewed fruit and lingering spicy cigarette ash in the finish. £60",
"Cragganmore 25 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 51.4%",Single Malt Scotch,91,500,101 to 500 Dollars,"The first thing I wrote was, “classic Kilchoman.” Then I paused…because it’s true. Though still young, here’s a distillery that has established its own character. In this expression you get full integration between oak and distillery, a sparkling mix of seashell and the freshness of seaweed, touched with churned butter, driftwood, and fresh-kilned peat. On the tongue, there’s samphire, peat, sweet barley, and an herbal kick. This is Kilchoman coming of age, assured and confident.",
"Compass Box Great King Street Experimental TR-06, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,48,0 to 100 Dollars,"Produced at Tullibardine distillery in 1989, this ex-bourbon hogshead has yielded 299 bottles. The expression lives up to its name with rum and raisin ice cream on the nose; floral, with glacé cherries, dried apricots, and pistachio nuts. More nuts and lots of spice on the palate, plus dark chocolate, dates, and prunes. The finish is medium in length, with spicy, benign oak. £85",
"Lagavulin 37 year old, 51%",Single Malt Scotch,85,3000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Following on from the official 8 year old release of Bladnoch, distilled and matured under the current Raymond Armstrong regime, comes a 9 year old variant in the familiar distillery label series.

Acetone, tinned peaches in vanilla, and whipped cream on the floral nose. The palate is clean and fruity, initially citric, with emerging apricots in honey, and fresh spices. More spice in the finish, with focuses on milk chocolate, cinnamon, and a suggestion of Madeira. €42",
"Glencadam 25 year old The Remarkable, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,500,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is the bigger, spicier, and more complex of the pair (see below). A prickly start leads to heavy peat smoke, pink and Szechuan peppercorns, vanilla, dark chocolate, angelica, then seaweed. The palate is oily, with a detonation of gunpowdery peat, licorice, smoked eel, and a feral edge that adds grunt. Layered and complex.",
"Lg4 Elements of Islay (distilled at Lagavulin), 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,85,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"The first Glen Garioch vintage to be exclusive to Travel Retail outlets and also the only one so far to post-date the closure of  their on-site floor maltings. This leads to a less peaty note in the spirit than in other vintages. Matured in first and second-fill bourbon casks. Tinned peaches in syrup and nougat on the nose. Sweet malt, heather honey, vanilla, restrained cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger on the palate. Subtle oak notes in the lengthy finish. £50",
"Johnnie Walker Explorers' Club Royal Route, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,159,101 to 500 Dollars,"One of the latest single cask bottlings (354 bottles) from Wemyss Malts specifically for the U.S., “A Day at the Coast” was sourced from the East Sutherland distillery of Clynelish. Ozone, warm sand, and wild grasses on the nose, plus a hint of honey, grated ginger, and a freshly-opened box of milk chocolates. The viscous palate features rock salt, white pepper, coconut, green apples, and a squeeze of lemon. Medium to long in the finish, softly citric, and salty.",
"Lagavulin Triple Matured Edition, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,85,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 1980 expression of The Dalmore Constellation has been solely matured in a Gonzales Byass Apostoles oloroso sherry butt. The resultant whisky is sweet on the nose, with dates, figs, milk chocolate-covered caramel, and finally a suggestion of eucalyptus. Briefly fruity on the palate, becoming bitter, with dark coffee notes. Long and spicy in the finish, with black pepper and licorice. Cask number 2140; 227 bottles.",
"Edradour 1999 Natural Cask Strength cask #295, 58.4%",Single Malt Scotch,85,118,101 to 500 Dollars,"The Glasgow-based independent bottler Douglas Laing & Co. Ltd. has been responsible for quite a number of releases from the ‘lost’ Lowland distillery of Rosebank, and this one was distilled during January 1990 and bottled in April 2012.

"Adelphi (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 1989 25 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,85,265,101 to 500 Dollars,"Nougat and a suggestion of fresh newsprint on the nose. Quite full-bodied, with a palate of mixed nuts and peaches in brandy. The finish is slightly waxy, with fruit and nut chocolate. ",
"Glenglassaugh Torfa, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,67,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is usually a bracing expression of Lagavulin and this year’s release doesn’t disappoint—smoldering peat, ozone freshness, but with greater sweetness than in 2011, though water shows how it is still just a little gawky. The palate is, yes, smoky, but there’s also light cereal, praline, violets, and seashore aromas aplenty. Fills the mouth with intensity. Okay, it’s edgy, but that’s what you expect.",
"Glenturret 26 year old 1986 (Hunter Laing/The Glenturret), 46.8%",Single Malt Scotch,85,505,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Distilled in February 2000 and matured in a single refill hogshead, this example of Arran is part of the Provenance range which highlights the season of distillation on the bottle label.

Voluptuous and fruity, notably spicy—pepper and ginger—plus mulled wine notes. Quite lengthy in the finish, with lingering spice. Peatiness is most evident here. 2,200 bottles.  ",
"Glenrothes Sherry Cask Reserve, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,88,0 to 100 Dollars,"Unlike ‘house’ bottlings of Highland Park, all of which are aged in sherry casks, this expression in Douglas Laing’s Old Malt Cask series has been matured in former bourbon wood. It was distilled in September 1996. Sweet and fruity on the nose, with nougat and peanut butter, plus a slightly herbal note, and finally discreet, sweet peat smoke. Medium-bodied, citric, and spicy, with a little smoke. Smokiness turns to ash in the finish, with citrus fruit and caramel. £70",

"Cuatro Series Oloroso, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"The decline in the Spanish market has resulted in Cardhu becoming more widely available, which is A Good Thing as far as I am concerned. This is a grassy malt, which at 12 years also has a heightened citric spray of sweet orange zest and a gingery aspect (it’s great with ginger ale). Intense and vibrant with macadamia and a light heathery note, the palate confounds expectations, having a thick chewiness before the grass zings through, adding lift. ",
"Littlemill 21 year old Second Release, 47%",Single Malt Scotch,85,207,101 to 500 Dollars,"As with the ‘Fiddich (reviewed in this issue), here’s a malt where an improved wood policy has brought a dram to life and added complexity. The Glenlivet has always been about lightness, but the trick is to have sufficient solid base to allow its flower to blossom, so as well as lily, orchid, and pineapple, there’s a thick creaminess that gently beds all of these flighty flavors down. With water, there’s mandarin and rose petal, and a sneeze of white pepper. Simply lovely. Value Pick",
"Darkness! (distilled at North British) 18 year old, 50.4%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,111,101 to 500 Dollars,"One of four Spring 2013 single cask releases from Wemyss Malts, Fruit Bonbons was distilled at Glen Garioch in 1989 and bottled during 2012. The out-turn was 325 bottles. Homemade lemonade and a dash of table salt on the early nose, then heather, ginger, and finally the sweetness of icing sugar and fudge. Apples coated in cinnamon, nutmeg, caramel, and dark treacle on the palate. The finish dries, from apple pie to oak and plain chocolate. £90",

Autumn berries and more ginger figure in the lengthy, slightly charred finish. £195",
"Bunnahabhain Ceobanach, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,85,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"The oldest expression in the Tullibardine lineup provides malt, cedar, stewed apples, and wood shavings on the nose. Mouth-coating, with orange and cocoa powder. Dries quite steadily, with oak lurking behind ripe bananas in the lengthy finish. Another very accomplished old Tullibardine, but the notably pleasing palate of the 20 year old just gives that bottling the edge. ",

They say they put a teaspoon of whisky from another distillery in each barrel; no longer a single malt. Whether they really do, who knows? So here is a blended malt with 99.99 percent of the whisky from one distillery. This has no peat and is sweet, honeyed, and rich, with vanilla, banana, lime sherbet, and tropical fruits. Almost certainly from Speyside…but where? £50",
"Arran Malt Orkney Bere, 56.2%",Single Malt Scotch,85,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"That Boutique-y Whisky Company is an independent bottler noted for quirky and very contemporary label design. The whiskies carry no age statements. Springbank Batch 2 has an outturn of 450 numbered bottles. Initially, overripe pineapples and dry hay on the oily nose, cut by a sprinkling of salt. Brittle toffee, and finally, hand-rolling tobacco. The palate is very fruity; more pineapple, plus peach, developing peat, plenty of spice, and more tobacco. The finish is relatively long and slightly herbal. £58",
"Jura 1984, 44%",Single Malt Scotch,85,1141,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Exclusive to the Travel Retail arena, Jura Turas-Mara takes its name from the Gaelic for “long journey.” It has been matured in an array of casks sourced from America, Spain, France, and Portugal.

satsumas—and finally, drying. £62",
"The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Auchroisk) 11 year old 2003 (cask #9), 56.4%",Single Malt Scotch,85,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is a sharp dresser, with a firm, solid mouthfeel and an altogether finer and more focused taste than Shieldaig Classic (see
below). It’s not coastal or earthy particularly, either. Instead the flavors are softer and built around mocha, smooth creamy toffee, and some soft fruit, including a touch of overripe banana and melon notes. The savoriness this time comes from a touch of pepper rather than salt.",
"Wemyss Malts Toffee Tuile (distilled at Aberfeldy) 1999, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,129,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is like listening to a quiet and understated musician and slowly starting to realize that there are all sorts of clever
nuances just beneath the surface. This evolves from a floral and welcoming nose, through a saline note and on to pepper and a Highland earthiness, but wrapped up in a rich, honeyed body. A nice balance between the ruggedness and sweet softness. All rather pleasant.",
"Oban 1999 Montilla Fino Finish Distillers Edition, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"Pale, with fresh perfumed/fragrant estery notes that touch on flower blossom, almond icing on a custard cake, and even a little candy floss. All very aromatically intense, with quite a hot focus on the tongue. With water you keep the concentration and add in lemon, jellied fruits, and light, dusty spiciness.",
"Cù Bòcan Limited Edition Virgin Oak, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,73,0 to 100 Dollars,"Named after a mythical hellhound that is said to stalk the area around Tomatin distillery, Cù Bòcan is lightly peated and matured in a combination of virgin oak, bourbon, and sherry casks. Just 60,000 liters are produced each year. Lemonade and coconut on the early nose, with developing almonds. Slightly earthy, with soft smoke. Rich, full mouthfeel, malt and honey, with the smoke more evident now, plus cinnamon and cloves. Nutty. Lingering oak and dry peat smoke in the finish.",
"Glenkinchie 2000 Amontillado Finish Distillers Edition, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,92,0 to 100 Dollars,"The Aberdeenshire distillery of Glen Garioch has released its first ever virgin oak-matured expression, which has employed heavily charred American oak barrels. According to master blender Rachel Barrie, “Glen Garioch’s intense flavor means it holds up well in a new fill cask.” Ripe peaches on the nose, spicy oak, vanilla, and more soft, floral notes in time. Malt, milk chocolate, nectarines, nougat, and mild cloves on the palate, while the finish is medium in length, with ginger and lively oak.",
"The Lost Distilleries Blend (batch 6), 49.3%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,512,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Batch 2 runs to 295 bottles and, in common with the rest of the range, carries no age statement. Peaches in brandy, ginger, honey, and milk chocolate on the pleasingly floral nose. The palate is silky, with more floral notes, plus cedar, oak, and soft spices. Almonds and allspice in the medium length finish. £63/500 ml",
"Chivas Regal Extra, 40%, ",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"One of two blended whiskies vying to be the official next Great King Street release, this is the peated version and it's gustier than the original, with less citrus and more peat. Indeed, it's impressively full-flavored, with peat in the driving seat and ginger cake, lime, and dark chocolate, biscuits and pepper in the mix. Best of all, unlike far too many Scotch whiskies this year, it doesn't use peat to hide immature spirit. £30",
"The Lost Distillery Company Gerston (batch 2/1), 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is a venerable Lagavulin which immediately shows its age with a nose that mixes the savory (hoisin sauce) with the mature notes of dunnage warehouse, sandalwood, and a minty lift. In time, there’s bog myrtle, old attics, rain-moistened wool, and a smokiness akin to a dead briar pipe. Slightly dull to start, it perks up in the mid-palate with lanolin and black olive brine, and a Darjeeling-like grippiness. Interesting for sure, but past its best. (1,868 bottles).",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Aultmore) 6 year old, 53.2%",Single Malt Scotch,85,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"This expression has been matured entirely in bourbon casks and offers a fresh nose of ozone and lemon, becoming quite fragrant in time. More mouth-coating than might be expected, yet easy drinking, with milk chocolate, malt, tropical fruits, and an edge of sea salt. The finish is medium in length, with wood spices. £40/liter",
"Glenfarclas 105, 60%",Single Malt Scotch,85,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is quite a saline Bowmore, but there is sufficient sliced apple, cut flowers, and fragrant smoke to give some degree of complexity to the nose. With water you get crisp oak, roasted barley, a hint of nectarine, bison grass, and wet reeds. Starting lean in the mouth, it darkens slightly into brambles and a dusty smokiness before picking up a citric tang on the finish. Slightly muted, but well balanced. £60/500 ml",
"Tomintoul 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,500,101 to 500 Dollars,"Toiteach A Dhà means ‘smoky two’ in Gaelic and follows the previously released Toiteach. The nose opens with aromatic smoke and brine, while red berries, caramel, nutmeg, and cloves develop. Significantly greater sherry wood influence on the palate compared to the last version, plus Jaffa oranges, pipe tobacco, nougat, cloves, black pepper, and smoked fish. Medium to long in the finish, with drying sherry, oak, pepper, salt, and dark chocolate.",
"Glen Scotia Heavily Peated 10 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,85,76,0 to 100 Dollars,"I had to double check that price. My feelings are well recorded on premium whiskies bottled at 40% and if you were to ask me whether the whisky's worth the price tag, the answer's no. That doesn't make it a bad whisky, though; far from it. It has a light, dusty, and fruity nose reminiscent of raspberry sherbet, and on the palate there is trademark smoke, and pleasant toffee and treacle. Good, but in stellar company here. (Travel Retail only) Price is per liter.",
"Duncan Taylor Octave (distilled at Glen Grant) 1995, 47.7%",Single Malt Scotch,85,151,101 to 500 Dollars,"A very laid-back start with the sweetness of the sherry cask bringing a fat, figgy, dried fruit aroma which initially suppresses the peat, only allowing a little pipe smoke and smoked meat to emerge. With water, there’s balsam, tar, dried seaweed, and fabric Band-Aid. This is repeated on the tongue, with dark fruits suddenly changing to spent kiln and bonfire ashes, but there needs to be more cohesion between the elements. £80",
"Pittyvaich 1989 25 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015), 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,85,400,101 to 500 Dollars,"Distilled on June 20, 1999 and bottled in November 2013, this expression from the Perthshire distillery of Edradour was matured for 14 years in a sherry butt. The outturn was 687 bottles. The nose is notably sweet, with jammy aromas —strawberry and raspberry— while hazelnuts and walnuts lurk in the background. The same fruit and nut notes from the nose carry over, along with sultanas, candied peel, Jaffa orange, and spicy leather. The lengthy finish is viscous and gingery. £70",
"Cadenhead’s (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 2005, 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,85,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"This Dalmore single cask variant was distilled in October 1996 and filled into a refill hogshead, which yielded 139 bottles in January 2014. Freshly-mown hay, then marzipan and nectarines on the well-spiced nose. Nutty caramel in time. The palate features Terry’s chocolate orange, vanilla, and nutmeg. Citrus fruits and malt in the finish, with hazelnuts and a hint of oak. £90",
"Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015), 56.8%",Single Malt Scotch,85,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"The nose is more reticent than that of its younger sibling, with less spice and succulent fruitiness. A hint of nougat, but overall, drier and ‘quieter.’ The palate is silky, with walnuts and allspice, while fruit notes are provided by plums. Following the overall theme here, the finish is also drier than that of the 16 year old variant, featuring a sprinkling of spicy cocoa powder. Relatively lengthy. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain. £90/liter",
"Balblair 2004 Sherry Matured, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,83,0 to 100 Dollars,"Pale gold, with nettles and green apple on the nose alongside almond, light bread crust, and freshly-baked sponge cake. In time, there’s Starburst sweets. Some heat, even at this relatively low strength. There are mineral accents and, with water, the signature ginger. The palate is very sweet and soft with jelly fruits. Clean and supple, especially with water. Zesty, with a refreshing acidic balance.",
"Edradour Ballechin 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Torfa is apparently Old Norse for “turf” or “peat,” and this no age statement Glenglassaugh was made using malt peated to around 20 ppm phenols. Heathery peatiness on the early nose, with dried fruits, malt, and cream soda. Ultimately, leathery, mellow smoke. Sweet and lively on the palate, after an initial flavor of coal soot, with ripe peaches, chili, and ginger, backed by floral peat and a hint of ozone. Spicy peat smoke in the relatively long and fruity finish. £40",
"Edradour The Fairy Flag 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,99,0 to 100 Dollars,"With only a 10 year old house bottling of Glenturret available, brand owners the Edrington Group have collaborated with independent bottler Hunter Laing to produce this ‘semi-official’ 26 year old expression, matured entirely in refill bourbon casks. Pineapple, dates, honey, and hard toffee on the floral nose. Full-bodied, waxy and chewy on the palate, with vanilla, ginger, cherry liqueur chocolates, and dark spices. Lengthy in the finish, with emerging bitter chocolate notes. £300",
"Dewar’s White Label Scratched Cask, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,26,0 to 100 Dollars,"With the majority of the blend coming from older single malts, this forms a counterpoint to I and II (see below). Toasted spices, fennel, black peppercorns, cocoa, malt loaf, split orange peels, and salted caramel invade the nose. The palate is a gluttony of chocolate. Beneath, look for dried fruits, macchiato, peanut shells, and some tannic bitterness as the older malts show their wares. It leaves a cocoa finish without the sweetness. A great concept for self-educating your palate. £106",
"Famous Grouse Mellow Gold, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,33,0 to 100 Dollars,"Bold, with a slightly blunt entrance. The cask influence is to the fore, mixing rum and raisin with a slight yeasty/dough-like edge that sits alongside caramelized fruits. In time, there’s sweet draff, malt loaf (with butter), and the smell of old cupboards. It gets creamier with water. Medium-bodied with a light savory note in the middle that then drifts toward Brazil nut, and Assam tea. A solid performer. Bristol Milk sherry rather than old oloroso. £55",
"Usquaebach 15 year old, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Aultmore is normally light and estery, and this pale dram is true to this. After a whiff of fresh turmeric, there’s an almost oily green note with William pear before acetone, and something akin to school Bunsen burners (a good smell) emerges. The palate is more coherent than the nose; sweet, rounded, and more substantial that you expect, with tinned pears in custard. Lively and charming; shows none of the firmness of youth suggested by the nose.",
"The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 1985 30 year old (Cask #612), 54.1%",Single Malt Scotch,85,1872,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"An interesting nose that’s somewhat akin to a peach cheesecake with slightly burnt pastry, or a heavily caramelized crème brûlée. Overt smoke is in check when neat. In the mouth, however, it comes through massively, mossy and oily and sitting on top of those fat fruits and sweet malt. Thicker and more farmyard-like than Port Charlotte. Great potential, with a sweetness that shows it’s pretty much there. £150",
"Kininvie 23 year old (Batch 3), 42.6%",Single Malt Scotch,85,173,101 to 500 Dollars,"A 15 year malt selected by the Loch & K(e)y Society. Hard apple cider leads the nose and is backed by honeyed malt and cinnamon-baked pear. The entry is lush caramel apple, but quickly transitions as the sheer power and spice of the mid-palate comes crashing in with oak, ginger, and pine. The finish is long, dry, and spicy with lingering heat. This is the kind of big, bold, dry whisky that American whiskey drinkers might enjoy. (Julio’s Liquors only)",
"Laphroaig 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Just 450 cases of this veteran expression from Old Pulteney have been released, offered in non-chill filtered format after maturation in a mixture of bourbon casks and Spanish oak sherry casks. Light fruit notes on the nose, notably tangerines, plus vanilla, lemon, and sea salt. Orchard fruits, spicy sherry, worn leather, and cocoa powder on the silky palate. Spicy and drying in the finish, with mild oak tannins.",
"Balblair 1999 (2nd release), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"This 20 year old single cask release from the Perthshire distillery of Aberfeldy runs to 242 bottles, matured in a hogshead. Apricots, green apples, ginger, and icing sugar on the nose. Soft fruits, notably peaches, gingery oak, and more icing sugar on the palate. Milky coffee, caramel, and eucalyptus in the slightly oaky, medium-length finish. £90",
"Glen Garioch 1797 Founder’s Reserve, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,85,46,0 to 100 Dollars,"The nose opens with savory notes. Richer, more fragrant and profound sherry than is present in the Fino or Manazanilla expressions. Full-bodied, with big, musty sherry notes and Seville oranges on the palate, plus lots of spice. Gum-tingling spices, with sultanas and dates in the finish.",
"Gordon & MacPhail 8 year old (distilled at Pulteney), 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is a distillery bottling from the now-demolished Lowland plant of Littlemill, near Glasgow, and the release consists of 4,550 bottles. There has been no chill filtration. Fresh pineapple and mango on the nose, inflated balloons, a hint of vanilla, and cocoa powder. Medium-bodied, with focused tropical fruits, ginger, and caramel. Lengthy in the finish, with gentle spice and milk chocolate-coated toffee. £130",
"Wemyss Malts The Hive, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,54,0 to 100 Dollars,"This North British has been led astray; well, subjected to three months’ confinement in first-fill oloroso sherry wood. Such are the ways of Darkness! There’s a savory nose of peppered filet, mustard seed, and tarragon. Interesting, but not to everyone’s taste. The creamy texture consists of evaporated milk, strong caramel, dark toffee, and black currant granola, though that savory character persists. Water pumps up the cream, raspberry, and cereal notes until it sees daylight, becoming almost a breakfast whisky. £70",
"Ardbeg Twenty One, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,500,101 to 500 Dollars,"Glenrothes is always this fascinating mix of the malty and the fruity and is one of those drams which needs time in the glass to open. Given that time, you will be rewarded with date, raisin, some fudge, and some real savory depth before a sprinkling of trail mix and a sweetening into nougat and caramel, spice and chocolate. A replacement for the old Select Reserve, this is a magnificent Glenrothes and at a great price, so don’t dare moan.",
"Bowmore 1999 vintage PX Hand-Bottled,  56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,85,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is master blender Ian MacMillan’s interpretation of what Bunna’ would have tasted like when the distillery was founded in 1881. There’s light smoke, coming across like smoked halibut, a mineral edge, white fruits, and a freshness like a freshly starched shirt. Water brings out almond. On the palate, the smoke offers a slightly peppery, almost Talisker-esque kick. Light lemon and sweet fruits in the center. Though there’s no age statement, none of the whiskies are under 10 years. £46",
"Lagavulin 30 year old, 52.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,500,101 to 500 Dollars,"Bright gold color. Fresh aromas of smoked olives, brine, exotic pepper, and fried bacon. Rich in body, and slightly oily in texture. In flavor, this is a big, dynamic whisky-smoked olives, sea salt, seaweed, mustard seed, all on a backdrop of vanilla sweetness. Long, smoky finish. 
",
"Edradour 9 year old 2006 Barolo Cask Matured (Batch 5), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"This 25 year old single cask bottling of Glen Garioch from Wemyss was one of a dozen released in late 2014. The hogshead in which maturation took place yielded 357 bottles. The nose gives apple, banana, vanilla fudge, nutmeg, and soft spices. Creamy and nutty on the palate, with a squeeze of lemon, soft toffee, and milk chocolate. The finish is medium in length, spicy and nutty, with cocoa powder and just a suggestion of smoke. £87",
"Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice 1997 (distilled at Tomatin), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,92,0 to 100 Dollars,"Isle of Arran Distillers has introduced a second edition of its Orkney Bere expression, made with an ancient variety of barley still cultivated in the Orkney Islands and aged in bourbon barrels. It is a cask strength 10 year old variant, and 4,890 bottles are available. The nose is quite oily, with ripe peaches and pineapple cubes, plus developing floral notes. Viscous and sweet on the palate, with tangerines, caramel, and rich spices. The finish is lengthy, with coconut and milk chocolate-coated caramel.",
"Ledaig 18 year old, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,85,115,101 to 500 Dollars,"This Jura expression was distilled in 1984 and matured in bourbon casks for 22 years before a further 6 years in Gonzalez Byass Matusalem sherry butts and 2 years in Amoroso and Apostoles oloroso sherry casks. The nose opens with beef gravy, soon followed by prunes, cherries, dark chocolate, and PX sherry. Full-bodied, rich and sweet on the palate, with lively spices, and more cherries, and chocolate. Long and fruity in the finish, with spicy sherry and licorice. £750",
"Auchroisk 25 year old, 51.2%",Single Malt Scotch,85,450,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is the Lowlander among Wemyss Malts’ dozen single cask releases for the fall of 2014. Maturation took place in a bourbon barrel, which yielded 295 bottles. Tinned peaches in syrup, caramel, mild vanilla, and damp tweed on the nose. Medium-bodied and intensely fruity on the palate, with apricots, raspberries, and ginger. Fruit notes linger in the finish, with spicy milk chocolate. £70",
"Linkwood 37 year old, 50.3%",Single Malt Scotch,85,900,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Dailuaine is a fascinating distillery and this has a fascinating nose, as it shows a heavy sulfury new make entering maturity and starting to pick up extra weight from the cask. There’s a glimpse of sweetness, a little fruit, but the dominant character is a savory meatiness (beef stock cubes). The palate shows dried mint and masses of this meaty/sweet interplay. Is it commercial? Probably not, but it tells a really important story. I like it a lot. £45",
"Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2016), 57.7%",Single Malt Scotch,85,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"Most of Auchroisk's malt goes into Diageo’s J&B blended, so a single malt release is an uncommon treat. Aged in refill sherry casks, this whisky has a nutty, roasted malt nose. On the palate it’s soft and lush, with honeyed roasted malt, walnut, ginger, and salt. A spicy mid-palate leads to a dry finish that abandons a lot of the flavors established. A solid mix of flavors, but the finish shows why it's often used for blending. (U.S. only)",
"Glen Scotia Distillery Edition, 56.9%",Single Malt Scotch,85,119,101 to 500 Dollars,"Following on from another 1999 single cask Aberfeldy in the previous batch of Wemyss Malts’ releases, we have Toffee Tuile, matured in a hogshead. The nose is sweet and approachable, with tinned fruit cocktail, vanilla, malt, and fresh ginger. Tropical fruit, brittle toffee, hazelnuts, a hint of caramel, and more ginger on the nose. The finish is medium in length, fruity, and mildly spicy. (393 bottles) £88",
"Bowmore 9 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,37,0 to 100 Dollars,"This vintage edition of Oban was distilled in 1999 and finished in montilla fino sherry casks, which lend a greater richness and complexity to the Oban house style without detracting from its essential characteristics. It was bottled in 2014. The nose is fragrant, with musky pineapple, and salted caramel. Silky on the palate, with Seville oranges, ginger nuts, and cloves, plus a faint suggestion of brine. Persistent orange and dry spice notes in the oaky, medium-length finish. £75",
"Cù Bòcan 2005 Vintage, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,85,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Cù Bòcan is the lightly-peated variant of Tomatin single malt, and while most Cù Bòcan is matured in a combination of sherry, bourbon, and virgin oak casks, this expression was exclusively aged in virgin oak. Fragrant on the nose, with lemon, lanolin, vanilla, poached pears, and peppery rye notes. Rich spice and vanilla on the palate, zesty and warming, with apple pie, and caramel. The finish is medium in length, with spiced fresh oak. (Worldwide except U.S.) £50",
"Tullibardine The Murray (2004 Vintage), 56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,85,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Bottled in 2014, this expression of Glenkinchie was distilled in 2000 and finished in amontillado sherry casks. The amontillado gives a more rounded feel and greater profundity to the single malt. Peaches, apricots, almonds, and soft ginger on the nose, Smooth and balanced on the palate, gently spiced and nutty, with cherries, caramel, discreet sherry, and vanilla. The medium-length finish features vanilla and lingering, spicy Jaffa oranges, drying slowly to oak. £63",
"Littlemill 25 year old Private Cellar Edition, 50.4%",Single Malt Scotch,85,3000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"The sixth incarnation of Master of Malt’s cult blend of closed distillery whiskies contains Port Ellen, Brora, Mosstowie, Glenisla, Imperial, Caperdonich, and Glen Mhor with grain whisky from Port Dundas. Apples and sugar browning in a pan, smooth driftwood, and dairy fudge, but with the Glenisla it’s noticeably smokier than earlier batches. Sweet blancmange initially, before it soars to a tangy, spicy peak; the peat smoke backed by white pepper, ground ginger, peanuts, and florentines. Smokin’ liquid history. (534 bottles) £350",
"Buchanan’s Deluxe 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,30,0 to 100 Dollars,"A new oloroso-forward Chivas positioned to split between the 12 and 18 year olds? I got this. Refined and inviting nose of lemon pith, black fruits, and Kola Kubes. The velvety texture is wonderfully smooth, redolent of an apricot custard Danish, lime zest, raisin, currant, mixed peel, and walnut, with a growing bitter-lemon note. Quite unique finish, like sucking on lumpy Spanish lemons speckled with spices. (LA, NY, Miami, Chicago, Northern California, but will go national)",
"Buchanan’s Master, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"A pale primrose of a dram. Waxed lemon, salted butter pats, white peach, honey, and the wood smoke from green stems. A sip brings Highland toffee, honey, chocolate fudge, rich tart fruits, with dried apple, raisin, mixed peel, and a late appearance of malt, pepper, and smoke. It wraps up with a glossy, clingy finish, but it’s short. Experimenting with water nudges peanut brittle, pralines, and fudge to the surface. Overall, a very decent drop.",
"Duncan Taylor 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Remarkably rich color, indicative of a first-fill cask. A clean if hot nose with carpenter’s workbench, Comice pear, and lots of oak. Aultmore’s acidity comes through on the palate, with its zingy intensity cutting through the wood and achieving a certain balance. The palate shows a mix of fruit and wood sugars. Young certainly, but bottled at the right time given the intensity of the wood element. Water makes it more sappy and summery. Not hugely complex, but fun.",
"Duncan Taylor Five Star, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,17,0 to 100 Dollars,"Brimming with distillery character. Gentle malty notes come through initially, accompanied by apple core and classic ‘Farclas weight. The alcohol, though high, is not obtrusive. In time there’s some orange marmalade, and this bittersweet element helps to add another layer of complexity. Water brings out toffeed depth. Even neat it isn’t too hot, showing heft rather than bludgeoning power. In time there’s black cherry, chocolate, and a hint of smoke. Highly recommended.",
"Sir Edward’s Smoky, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,22,0 to 100 Dollars,"Exclusive to the Travel Retail arena, this expression of Auchentoshan was aged for 14 years in a mix of bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. It is not chill-filtered prior to bottling. The nose yields polished oak, malt, milk chocolate, marzipan, figs, apricots, and ginger. Rich and full on the palate, spicy, with vanilla, mango, and finally Seville oranges. Medium to long in the finish, with almonds, soft oak, and warming spices.",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company 30 year old (distilled at Macallan), 46.5%",Single Malt Scotch,85,604,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Higher in strength than the standard Glen Scotia 10 year old, this heavily peated expression is part of the distillery’s Legends of Scotia series, and celebrates Campbeltown's historic Picture House. Just 6,000 bottles. Fruity peat on the nose, with lots of apricot and peach notes. Finally, fresh cigarette ash. Voluptuous in the mouth, and fruity, then sweet spice and drier peat notes develop. The finish is medium to long, with spicy tar. €70",
"Dewar’s 18 year old The Vintage, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"The impact given by secondary maturation in small (octave) sherry casks is what sets this range apart. Here, Glen Grant’s light fruits are given a darker twist, with some bodega notes, blackberry, and a surprising note of curry spices before milk chocolate develops; this is particularly apparent on the palate. The palate is gentle and quite creamy (cream sherry?) but it doesn’t like water. A pleasing dram. £99",
" Dewar’s White Label, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,25,0 to 100 Dollars,"Good to see Pittyvaich back in the Special Release roster. Here we have the heavy, nutty character of the distillery given full expression. The emphasis here is on a mix of nuts, cake mix, and dense fruits: even a little hint of cigarette tobacco. When neat, the palate has real density that is enlivened by water, which brings out fresher—and decidedly more green—notes. Worth a dram.",
"J&B Rare, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,23,0 to 100 Dollars,"Initially very ozonic, fresh, and marine. So much so that you don’t notice the smoke which is slowly building. Everything is very restrained, some cold-smoked fish, mineral, and—in time—a hint of the mash tun. That mineral note continues on the palate, which broadens into ginger nuts in the middle of the tongue. All very well-balanced, and at its best neat.",
"Glen Moray Elgin Classic Port Cask Finish, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,30,0 to 100 Dollars,"As pale as you'd expect, this year’s Special Release ‘limited’ bottling has a sweet, bready softness to it making it less angular than previous expressions. The smoke comes across very gently, allowing the sweet grassiness of the spirit the upper hand until water is added. The palate stirs in some emulsion paint, a pleasing lift of sulfur and anise, and gradually deepens. With water there are more smoke and marine notes.",
"Grant’s Elementary Carbon 6 year old, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,30,0 to 100 Dollars,"Balblair has released two Travel Retail-exclusive variants of its 2004 vintage, matured in bourbon barrels and sherry casks respectively. The Sherry Matured version was aged in American and Spanish oak sherry butts. It is only available in Asia. Oriental spices, soft leather, and damsons on the nose. Milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight in time. The palate features lively spices, cooking apples, vanilla, medium-sweet sherry, and hazelnuts. Spices persist in the finish, with honey and raisins.",
"Pig’s Nose, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,29,0 to 100 Dollars,"After eight no-age-statement releases of Edradour’s heavily-peated Ballechin, the brand finally comes of age as a core product. It is bottled at 10 years of age after maturing in a combination of bourbon barrels and oloroso sherry casks. Earthy peat and fragrant spices on the nose, old leather, and faint toffee. The palate initially offers very fruity peat, then newer leather, aniseed, and plain chocolate, with lingering fruity peatiness. More plain chocolate and ginger in the smoky, medium-length finish.",
"Ainsley Brae Oak Cask Matured Highland, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,28,0 to 100 Dollars,"What lies beneath the surface of Dewar’s? Here, the blend is finished in virgin and first-fill bourbon casks especially charred, then scratched to enable deeper penetration. Thick wedge of vanilla and fudge with oaky accents, a dusty mouthfeel pulling in vanilla, light lemon, milk chocolate, and sweet toffee, ending on a cocoa powder note. Compared with regular White Label, this is less obviously sweet and creamy, adds complexity, and opens a bourbon connection. Certainly, this is up to scratch.",
"Ainsley Brae Sherry Cask Finished Highland, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,30,0 to 100 Dollars,"This has enticing flavors that will meet with the approval of the regular Grouse drinker: heady florals with fresh peach, light honey, pecan, and underlying caramel. The palate is soothing with vanilla and tangerine, hallmarks of Grouse, plus rosewater, almond, and whispering spices. Gently does it, that’s the key to this: kick back and relax. This showcases the Midas touch of Gordon Motion’s skills in liquid alchemy. A great value blend to boot. £22",
"Grangestone Sherry Cask Finish Highland, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,29,0 to 100 Dollars,"The blended malt in the series is drawn from select aged Highland single malt whiskies chosen by Stewart Laing. A luxuriant nose of rich, runny caramels, deliciously malty, and balanced with notes of dried apple, mixed peel, and pecan shells layered over warm spice. Smooth, with a light to medium body showing toffee apple, raisin, and caramel, tasting fatter with time and yielding pineapple notes. A finish of soft, sucked toffees and tingly spices. A top-class, well-executed drink.",
"Highland Queen Majesty 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Here, the distillery character is more restrained, as if it is taking a period of calm reflection before the next evolution. There’s slightly more maltiness here and the texture has changed into a light acacia honey stickiness and a development of more oxidized notes, showing a gentle maturation. It’s one I kept going back to; teasing, slightly elusive, but rewarding. £1,300",
"Trader Joe’s Bourbon Cask Finish Highland, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,20,0 to 100 Dollars,"As if making up for lost time, wee bottles of Kininvie are popping out every month. This is a fine demonstration of the distillery style which sits—appropriately enough—between the lightness of Glenfiddich and the fruity sweetness of Balvenie. Here, flowers are to the fore, along with creme anglaise, and a light herbal edge. There’s some weight to the palate, but very little oakiness. A perfumed finish akin to elderflower maintains the frothy floral aspect. A perfect spring dram. £120",
"Glenrothes 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"Now you see it, now you don’t. Brought back like Frank Sinatra for last year’s 200th anniversary celebrations, here’s Laphroaig in gentle Islay sunset mode, all soft fruits and oils. There’s typical marine-like smokiness of course—particularly on the palate. I’d go neat with this to observe what is rather excellent balance. And snap it up, who knows when there will be another?",
"Clan MacGregor, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,10,0 to 100 Dollars,"This Balblair vintage replaced the previous 1997 bottling, and maturation took place in a mix of bourbon barrels and sherry butts. The nose offers milk chocolate, candied ginger, caramel, honey, and musty oranges. Relatively dark fruits on the palate, with licorice, honey, and vanilla. A medium to long finish, spicy, with slight oakiness.",
"Grant’s Cask Editions Ale Cask Finish, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,20,0 to 100 Dollars,"The entry level, no age statement expression of Glen Garioch, offered at an unusually high ABV for a single malt in this price range.  Grapefruit , lively spice, vanilla, malt, and black pepper on the nose. Milk chocolate, chili, cooking apples, and something slightly savory on the palate. Citrus fruits and lots of spice in the relatively lengthy finish. An unusual and pleasing dram for the money. £32",
"Glen Scotia Double Cask, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"Offered in the ‘Distillery Labels’ series by Gordon & MacPhail, this expression from Wick’s Pulteney distillery hearkens back to the era when Gordon & MacPhail was its principal bottler, and 8 its standard age. Aged in refill bourbon barrels. Soft fruits, dried grass, and faint wood smoke on the nose. Smooth and nutty on the palate, with smoky spice, a sprinkling of salt, and ripe pears. The finish is medium in length, mildly peppered, nutty, and oaky.",
"Glenglassaugh Revival, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"Having previously appeared in 8 and 12 year old versions, Wemyss dropped the age statement from their easygoing honey-drenched dram. Fortunately, the nose of light honey, lavender, heather, and spring blossoms confirms that it’s business as usual. Melon, mango, passion fruit, and a deft touch of spice give this a sweet, fruity profile. Gentle heat persists into the finish with honeyed sweetness. It’s crying out for a perfect scoop of vanilla ice cream. Still a crowd pleaser. £37",
"Tomintoul With A Peaty Tang, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"A non-chill filtered bottling matured in a mixture of bourbon and red wine casks. The nose offers a big early orange hit, vanilla, and red wine notes. Smooth on the palate; more orange, black pepper, and spicy red wine.  The finish is relatively long and spicy, with bitter chocolate orange. (Travel Retail exclusive)",
"Glenrothes Bourbon Cask Reserve, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"The mid-priced Fèis Ìle release took Bowmore off into darker than usual territory. The key here was how the cask (PX is, after all, as sweet a sherry as you can find) had been so well controlled. Rather than being a thick, sweet mess, a balance was struck between the two elements: the cask added density and raisined fruit, while the distillery gave aromatic smoke and orange, and both combine to layer on molasses, leather, and dark chocolate. A success. £100",
"Balblair 16 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"The annual (albeit limited) Loch Gorm release allows you to chart Kilchoman’s development in sherry casks. Here, first-fill and refill sherry casks (oloroso to be precise) were used. The latter seem to have more of a say, as the distillery character is more apparent: sweet fruit, marine smoke, and clementine, before the golden raisin from the cask develops. The palate is smokier and also more overtly sherried. A bolder style, but very well balanced. Limited, so get in there ASAP.",
"BenRiach Herodotus 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"This expression of Edradour was distilled in April 2006 and was the fifth batch to be matured in Barolo wine hogsheads. Fruity farmyard aromas, spice, then developing heather honey, soft oak, and caramel. Earthy fruit notes on the palate, with walnuts, malt, and pepper. Mildly mouth-drying in the medium-length finish, with aniseed and black pepper. (2,000 bottles) £50",
"Benriach 12 year old 1994 vintage, 59.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,54,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured in refill bourbon barrels, this Tomatin is softly floral on the nose, with sweet fruit spices, pineapple, vanilla, and honey. The palate is fresh and fruity, with cream, milk chocolate, and nutty spice. Fruity to the end, notably ripe apples and red berries, plus more milk chocolate before slightly drying oak notes develop. £70",
"Benromach 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 18 year old variant of Ledaig from Tobermory distillery on Mull was released in spring 2015 and is finished in oloroso sherry casks. Old warm leather predominates on the early nose, with salt, pencil shavings, a suggestion of asphalt, and dried fruit. Big fruit and spicy peat notes on the robust palate, which features sherry and a sprinkling of brine. Drying slowly, with licorice and marginally tannic oak behind persistent smoke.",
"Cadenhead's, (distilled at Blair Athol), 1989, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,84,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distilled in 1990, this rare expression was matured in refill American oak hogsheads. Quite shy on the nose, even at cask strength. Ultimately, faintly floral notes, with pear drops, vanilla, and linseed. Very smooth on the palate, with soft fruity malt, vanilla, peach, and dark berries. Buttery mango and nutmeg in the finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (3,954 bottles)",
"Bruichladdich WMD II, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is a 1978 veteran from the rebuilt Linkwood Distillery. The nose is slightly musty, even bitter, with sawdust and apple peel. The palate is sweet, with a suggestion of sherbet ‘fizz,’ elusive peatiness, and fruit spice, plus vanilla, walnuts, and ultimately, slightly grippy oak. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (6,114 bottles)",
"Bruichladdich Links 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is the fourteenth 12 year old Lagavulin bottling in the series and was aged in refill American oak hogsheads. Vanilla and wood smoke on the early nose, then black pepper, lemon, marine aromas, and scented notes, with a hint of peaty yeast. Big, sweet, and direct on the smooth palate, with milk chocolate and black pepper, while the smoke keeps building. The finish is long and smoky, with persistent pepper. Diageo Special Releases 2016 bottling.",
"Bruichladdich Full Strength 1989 vintage 13 years old, 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,84,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"This is the third single cask Distillery Edition cask strength. It was distilled in December 1996 and bottled as a 20 year old in April 2016. Coconut ice and vanilla fudge on the very sweet, confectionery-led nose, with a suggestion of salt in the background. Full and supple on the palate, with a big hit of ripe apples, then cinnamon and nutmeg. Very long in the finish with light black pepper. A Glen Scotia for those with a sweet tooth! (Distillery only bottling) £95",
"Gordon & MacPhail Single Cask #1961 (distilled at Bruichladdich) 1989 Vintage, 57.9% ABV",Single Malt Scotch,84,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"The latest addition to Bowmore’s core range is presented at the unconventional age of 9 years. Matured predominantly in oloroso sherry casks, with some bourbon cask-aged spirit thrown into the mix. The result is a whisky featuring drinking chocolate, black pepper, and soft peat on the nose. Sherry and sweet peat notes merge nicely on the palate, with dates, plums, and light caramel. Smoky brine in the medium-length finish. £30",
"Dalwhinnie Distillers Edition, 1990 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"The latest vintage expression of Tomatin’s peated Cù Bòcan was aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Fishy smoke on the nose, with ripe red apples, toffee, milk chocolate, and malt. Creamy mouthfeel; ripe pears in peat smoke, sweet spices. White pepper, plain chocolate, and a lick of licorice in the relatively long and lively finish. (11,400 bottles)",
"Cask & Thistle (distilled at Glen Grant), 15 year old, 1988 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distilled in 2004, The Murray was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and is offered at cask strength, non-chill filtered. The nose opens with confident, sweet fruit notes—overripe bananas and peach slices—with background milky coffee. Rich and sweet on the palate, developing vanilla spices, chewy tropical fruits. The finish is long, with cinnamon, licorice, and oak tannins.",
"Scott's Selection (distilled at Glen Grant), 26 year old, 1977 Vintage, 53.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,145,101 to 500 Dollars,"This bottling of 1990 whisky from the demolished Littlemill Distillery was initially matured in ten American and European oak casks before being married and finished in first-fill oloroso sherry casks. Boiled fruit sweets, subtle vanilla, red apple peel, and cereal on the nose. The palate is rich, sweet, and full. Intense fruitiness, then fruit spices, hazelnuts, and some oak notes. Very long in the finish, with aniseed and plain chocolate. Mildly tannic at the last. Complex and satisfying. (1,500 bottles)",
"Glenkinchie Distillers Edition 1991 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Overlook the fact that this bottle is saddled with one of the most impenetrable closures known to mankind. Unperturbed, this blend flaunts its big toffee aromas, whole almond, and floral top notes. With light fudge and gentle orange influences, it is smooth and rounded, top loaded with spice and hazelnut at the front of the mouth. More grain character and roasted spices show through on the finish.",
"Glenrothes Select Reserve, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"This adheres to the rules laid down by blender Keith Law. The nose yields mint toffees, cereal notes, butterscotch, and whole peppercorn. Juicy orange, with elements of burnt orange, dark toffees, and a pleasant balance of sweetness form the palate, followed by a wave of peppery spices and late dashes of dates and sultana. The finish has more peppery spice and peppermint. Obey the Law.",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glentauchers), 14 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"A toasty and spicier interpretation of an 18 year old blend. Toffee, salted pecans, Dundee cake, and sultana aromas. A beautiful, thick texture replete with ripe red fruits, cardamom, fennel, and star anise. Caramels drift past on a river of spice, wreathed in a fine layer of smoke, then oak, mixed nuts, and cracker bread. The fruity sweetness is momentary and fleeting, leaving the front of the mouth loaded with spice.",
"Duncan Taylor 'Rarest of the Rare' (distilled at Glenury Royal), Cask #3049, 20 year old, 1984 vintage, 43.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,180,101 to 500 Dollars,"It begins innocently enough. Ripening strawberries, cotton candy, and fudge on the nose, but with an undertow of devil-may-care spiciness. Soft mandarin citrus, vanilla fudge, sponge cupcakes, and a decent wedge of malt form the core of the palate; the spice is disappointingly mild considering the potential of the first sniff. Sweet and syrupy finish. Still, solid enough to make your world better at the end of a hard day.",
"Highland Park 1986 vintage 19 year old  (Cask #2498), 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"This blend delivers just enough peat turf to live up to the name, without alienating the peat phobics. A pleasant nose of chocolate hazelnut, pecan nut, dried tropical fruits, and gentle wood and peat smoke.  Orange, toffee, banoffee pie, Kola Kubes, and a little spiciness. Plenty of flavor even if the mouthfeel is a little thin. A short finish with a spicy flare and a few lingering smoky embers. (Total Wine exclusive) Price per 1.75 liter",
"Rosebank 1992 21 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,500,101 to 500 Dollars,"Bottled as 350 ml twin-pack along with the American oak version, this is deeply resinous, with clove, shoe leather, high-grade engine oil—an Aston Martin workshop, not a back alley garage—alongside dried fruits. Similar in tone to some old Caribbean rums with liqueur chocolate and Friar’s Balsam. The tannins yield slightly, showing chicory and raisin. ‘Old style’ Macallan, and another which, while strong, is best neat. £350",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Longmorn) 30 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"Vanilla laced with spice, fondant icing, grapefruit peel, and lime zest leave the vanilla and floral notes lower down the pecking order. In the mouth, grapefruit and orange dominate the vanilla, yet the mouthfeel is thinner and the acidity tips toward the taste of bitter orange seeds. A lingering bitter orange finish.",
"Mackillop's Choice 14 year old 1989 vintage (distilled at Macallan), 58.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Honey, fudge, a little melon and white grape, dry roasted spices, and peppercorn, but noticeably less fruit than the age-statement varieties. The palate has pulpy white melon, lemon, lime, and some grapefruit acidity, before sweetening with honey. Quite tart at times, some peppery spice collaborates before the vanilla cream and green fruits take charge. A clean, juicy finish of lemon zest and mild spices coats the throat.",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Rosebank) 1989 Vintage, 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Justerini & Brooks sold scotch in the U.S. before Prohibition. This light, Speyside-style blend has grassy notes, with crystalized lemon slices, Bramley apple peel, woodsmoke, and almonds. Light and sweet on the tongue, it unpacks lemon peel, satsuma, juicy watermelon, pepper, and aniseed. Grain whisky and herbal notes creep in late and permeate the finish.",
"Murray McDavid (distilled at Rosebank) 1992, 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is finished for 8 months in tawny port pipes and is quite restrained on the early nose, opening up to reveal rose petals, milk chocolate, and double cream.  The palate is floral, with raisins  and red currants. Drying in the  finish, with peppery oak and  cinnamon.",
"Springbank 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,68,0 to 100 Dollars,"The black-labeled Carbon relates to heavily charred casks, which bring aromas of toffee, raisin, chocolate, dark concentrated fruits, barbecued meat, and ashy soot. The smokiness broods malevolently if you leave the glass. The texture feels too light to shoulder the flavors of dark char, toffee, spice, and dark fruity chocolate as the balance becomes swamped in smoke. It’s like a young child wearing their father’s thickest winter overcoat. (Global Travel Retail only)",
"Murray McDavid (distilled at Strathisla) 1976, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"Stick your snout into aromas of rich tea biscuits, honey, tangerine, toasted almond chips, candied pineapple chunks, and a prickle of spice. It’s youthful but integrated, the grain domineering over the malt. A likable flavor sequence begins with lovely honey sweetness, honeydew melon, and pear, before a citrus phase, followed by an ominous wave of spice which vanquishes the sweet fruits, leaving a swift, spicy finish. (12,000 bottles for U.S.)",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Strathisla), Cask #8510, 25 year old, 48.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,185,101 to 500 Dollars,"Behind its comic book label, this pallid 3 year old, 40% malt content whisky has a nose of vanilla frosting, fudge, caramel, whole lime, orange peel, fresh apple, nougat, sesame seed bars, and faint notes of ground black pepper This works beautifully in long drinks, with its light character of dominant lemon flavors, vanilla, fizzy sherbet, and traces of spice. No messing around: it’s sharp, tangy, zingy, and refreshing. (12,000 bottles for U.S.)",
"Laphroaig 40 year old, 42.4%",Single Malt Scotch,87,500,101 to 500 Dollars,"The nose is perfumed, with citrus fruit, ginger, wood spice, and nutty toffee. Green apples, more nuts, coconut, vanilla, and cocoa powder on the palate. Milk chocolate and soft spices in the medium-length, mildly herbal finish.",
"Murray McDavid 9 year old 1997 vintage (distilled at Macallan), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"An initial aroma of carrot peelings gives way to cedar, allspice, lemon, and chamomile; with water added, carrot cake, almond shell, and lemon icing emerge. On the palate there’s chamomile tea with lemon and clove, candied violet, orange, and cedar, swooping into a finish of oak and dried flowers. (Total Wine & More)",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Ledaig), cask #2, 1994 vintage, 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"A delicate grassy nose with aromas of bread dough, green bananas, cardamom, and lemon. Light-bodied on the palate, with pleasant flavors of cardamom, lemon, and white pepper, it rushes through to a more substantial finish of roasted walnuts, tobacco leaf, unsweetened chocolate, and oak. (Total Wine & More)",
"Tobermory 15 year old, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,84,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"Sulfury funk on the nose might intimidate, but it’s a harbinger of the whisky’s strong sherry influence. There are also aromas of cinnamon, allspice, tangy stewed fruit, roasted almonds, and saline. The palate is intensely floral, with raisins, dried figs, hazelnuts, red berries, and a little milk chocolate. Richly flavored, but light-bodied; a gentle sherried whisky. (Total Wine & More)",
"	Bruichladdich 'Rocks', 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"On the nose, spiced plums, cinnamon, clove, ginger, and cooked fruit mingle with seawater and a waft of guava. A tug of war between sweet—orange oil, cookies with lemon icing—and spice—cloves, dried ginger—resolves into a finish of milk chocolate with a hint of hookah tobacco. This is light and a bit hot, but its perfumy character shows well. Finished in first-fill bourbon barrels. (Trader Joe’s)",
"Glenfiddich 26 year old, 43.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,500,101 to 500 Dollars,"The fifth batch of Adelphi’s Fascadale single malt comprises a marriage of two Spanish oak casks and three American oak casks of Highland Park. The outturn is 1,483 bottles. Icing sugar, vanilla, milk chocolate, apricots, plus mildly smoky malt on the nose. Full-bodied and fruity on the palate, with toffee, black pepper, and a hint of peat in the background. The medium-length finish is slowly drying. £45",
"The Dalmore Gran Reserva, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Banana chips, peppercorn, coriander stalks, dry grasses, cracker bread, faint lemon zest, butterscotch, and green apple; more grain than malt character evident. With watery citrus, butterscotch, walnut, lemon peel, and caramel initially, it’s lighter-bodied but balanced. It develops more spices and a fine texture as it dilutes, lifted by cinnamon, caramel, and gentle spices. Overlook the hard-to-love nose, and this is tasty both neat and over ice.",
"Isle of Skye, 8 year old, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,29,0 to 100 Dollars,"Buttercream, fresh-cut bread, taffy candy, citrus, and a distinctive hoppy note from the craft ale casks. Charmingly smooth but quite light bodied, there is warmed bramble fruit, bitter grapefruit peel, and plenty of peppery spice. This stands up well to other ale-cask finished whiskies, but in the Grant’s range there are better whiskies with more to offer.",
"Islay Mist, 17 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Initially aged in first-fill bourbon barrels, then finished in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. On the nose, ripe peaches, apricots, vanilla, caramel, and mildly smoky sherry surface. The slightly viscous palate offers more sherry, wood spices, cinnamon, salted caramel, oak, peanuts, and a hint of salt. The finish is medium in length, herbal, and drying, with sea salt.",
"Lombard Gold Label, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,17,0 to 100 Dollars,"A combination of first-fill and refill bourbon casks was employed for maturation, followed by 6 months of finishing in first-fill oloroso sherry butts. The nose proclaims youthfulness, with metallic notes and a hint of yeast, but the sherry casks provide walnut, old leather, tobacco, and orange. Sherry, freshly planed wood, white pepper, and red currants on the palate. Plums dipped in sherry on the finish.",
"Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2003), 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,500,101 to 500 Dollars,"Ebony colored whisky with dark aromas of dense fruitcake, fresh fig, Medjool dates, sultana, and Christmas spices of nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon, though a struck-match note lurks within. The treacle-thick palate has Coca-Cola, clove, aniseed, eucalyptus, sultanas, leather, blackcurrant, black cherry, dried fig, and raisin. The currant-bun finish is tannic and woody; tastebuds flinch and recoil. This is a grizzled old-timer best left to adventurous souls.",
"Compass Box 'The Spice Tree', 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"Sweet, with a touch of saline on the nose: almond cream, lemon curd, fresh coconut, kumquat, and vanilla salt water taffy. The palate is soft and velvety, with apples and pears, toffee, a sprinkling of grapefruit and kumquat, and a touch of guava. Lingering sweetness on the finish, though it fades quickly. Water doesn’t do it any favors; taste this neat.",
"GlenDronach 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,136,101 to 500 Dollars,"Light to medium in body, but quite flavorful. Firm spice notes and subtle brine (both of which are often found in Northern Highland malts) makes the whisky fresh and quite lively. There’s a soothing, mouth-coating, toffee sweetness providing balance and depth. This is the first distillery bottling of Balblair available here in the U.S. in a long time, and it is very welcomed.",
"Auchentoshan 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,48,0 to 100 Dollars,"Finished in a pedro ximinez cask. This is the sweetest and most tactile of the three whiskies. Peat smoke married with lush notes of sultana, ripe peaches, pineapple, white chocolate, shortbread, and thick honey. Delicate floral notes (heather, lavender) add finesse. I expected a darker personality with the sherry finish. I was pleasantly surprised.",
"The Glenrothes Alba Reserve, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"A peated version of Benriach that was also finished in a port pipe. There is a really nice blend of flavors here; a sweet malty foundation layered with ripe red fruit notes (raspberry, strawberry preserve, currant) and a firm blanket of smoke that goes on and on. All the flavors are bold, but they’re equally balanced. Not a subtle whisky but quite entertaining. (Binny’s Beverage Depot exclusive)",
"Stronachie, 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"The oldest of the group, and it shows. When compared to younger expressions, there’s less peaches and more citrus (lemon, tangerine). It is thicker on the palate-with notes of fat barley and crème brulee-before dry, resinous oak notes intensify. Dry, spicy finish. Not as even-keeled as younger expressions, but quite dynamic.",
"Hazelburn, 47.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"Pale gold color. Aromas reminiscent of a holiday spice cake-ginger, cinnamon, honey, and a touch of citrus fruit. Medium bodied, but it coats the palate-there's some viscosity here. The flavors are rather soothing and very much like its aroma, with a malty sweetness throughout and a lingering finish.
   Style: Highland single malt Scotch whisky. Price: high $80s. Limited availability. 
   The owners of Blair Athol have chosen not to export this whisky to the U.S. For this reason it can be rather difficult to find, only occasionally being imported by one of the independent bottlers. This particular expression is a very good example from this distillery.",
"Caol Ila, 58.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,153,101 to 500 Dollars,"Aged in bourbon casks and then enhanced in Rioja wine casks. A mélange of red berry fruits, firm malt, thick vanilla and spicy oak, along with a hint of grape skin, anise, and orange peel. Gritty, dry finish.",
"John Walker & Sons Bicentenary Blend, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,95,1000,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Drawn from stocks aged at least 28 years, this magnificent blend begins with aromas of burning heather, toffee, nuts, cigar smoke, leather, raisins, broken orange pekoe tea leaves, fruit loaf, black licorice, allspice, and cinnamon. Truly classic Johnnie Walker with smooth, warming flavors of orange, brown sugar, barley sugar, and gentle harmonious spice, followed by dark toffee, vanilla pod, candied peel, sultana, prune juice, malt, and cocoa.",
"Benromach 12 year old Origins (Batch 2), 50%",Single Malt Scotch,84,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Aged in used bourbon barrels. A fresh, appetizing whisky of brine and white pepper, with an underlying foundation of vanilla, barley, and grassy/hay-like notes. A very subtle teasing of citrus lingers throughout. Very clean and straight-forward, with an appetizing finish. A whisky aperitif?",
"Glenfiddich Age of Discovery 19 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,123,101 to 500 Dollars,"It is unusual to find a Bruichladdich whisky with this much sherry influence-this one is aged in a refill sherry hogshead. I must admit that I generally like a less sherried Bruichladdich-it makes it easier to appreciate the distillery's subtle complexities. While there certainly is more than enough sherry to go around in this whisky, the distillery character does manage to fight its way through. This whisky's strong point is that the sherry influence is clean and not insipid like some sherried whiskies. Chewy caramel, toffee, and ripe fruit notes are most evident in this whisky, with Bruichladdich's signature-an appetizing fresh briny character-emerging midway on the palate through to the finish. If you like Bruichladdich and you appreciate a cleanly sherried whisky, then I think you'll enjoy this one.",
"Edradour Port Cask, 6th Release, cask #383, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured in oloroso casks. The oloroso takes what is typically a pleasingly honeyed, but not particularly complex, malt and adds a layer of fruit to it. Crisp, clean notes of lemon, pineapple, and ginger, are softened by honeyed malt, vanilla, and hay. Soft, lingering finish. 
",
"Glen Ord, Milroy’s of Soho Single Cask, 1999, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,74,0 to 100 Dollars,"A nice example of what port wood finishing should do for a whisky. The port influence (finished one year in a port pipe) has taken what would normally have been a fairly straight-forward whisky when it is young-clean, light, and dry with subtle notes of herbs and spices-and added some extra weight along with balancing sweet toffee and full fruit, without dominating.

"Tomintoul 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,54,0 to 100 Dollars,"What is it with all these older, sherried bottles of Glen Grant from the independent bottlers, anyway? Fortunately, this is one of the nicer ones. The balance of sherry and oak is commendable, and the flavor is clean with that Glen Grant “dried herb” character still evident. Sweet fruit notes (berries in honey, peach pits, sultana, ripe grape) along with almonds and tobacco fill out the palate. Clean, warming finish. 
",
"Laphroaig Cairdeas, 50.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured in amontillado casks. Pleasantly fresh, briny, and yeasty, which works nicely with the atypical toffee and nutty notes. Glenkinchie’s dry, grassy character emerges occasionally, as does some delicate background spice and a hint of lime. Pretty hefty stuff for Lowland malt.",
"Hazelburn 8 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"The first non-vintage Glenrothes in recent memory, allowing the distillery more flexibility in cask selection when making a bottling. True to Glenrothes, this expression is mouth-coatingly malty, with well-integrated bright fruit notes, creamy vanilla, praline and honey. Nutty, delicately spicy finish. 
",
"Glengoyne 1996 Vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,68,0 to 100 Dollars,"Fairly straight-forward but pleasing nonetheless. Creamy on the nose and palate. Nicely malty, too, with interwoven notes of vanilla, caramel custard, and hazelnut, offset nicely by dry oak spices and a hint of peat. A calming whisky best enjoyed after a very stressful day. 
",
"Tomatin 30 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,220,101 to 500 Dollars,"Thick and very tactile. Malty, with good heft. Notes of vanilla, honey, biscuit, and caramel custard. A soothing, comforting whisky. On the surface, not very complex, but very satisfying nonetheless. 
",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glenburgie) 1990 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,130,101 to 500 Dollars,"Amber-gold colored (not as dark as the other Beltramo’s offering here), with notes of caramel, honey, heather, and bright fruit, evolving into gentle cinnamon, vanilla, and ginger. Soft finish. A Highland Park for a lazy afternoon. (Bottled for Beltramo’s Fine Wines & Spirits)",
"Auchentoshan 1999 Bordeaux Cask Matured, 58%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Style: Islay single malt scotch Color: Pale straw Aroma: Peat smoke-lots of it. Damp earth. Hint of olives and seaweed. Palate: Surprisingly gentle in texture and on the light side of medium in body. A malty sweetness balances the dry-ish peat smoke. Again the damp earth mid palate. An appetizing saltiness emerges towards the finish, but is fleeting. Smoky finish.",
"Tullibardine 1988, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Amber color. Rich, malty aroma with notes of vanilla, honey, oak, and floral undertones. Thick, mouth-coating texture. Flavors are big and malty, with notes of honey and vanilla up front, then becoming rather dry with oak and subtle citrus. Huge, long dry finish. 
",
"Wemyss Malts ‘Caribbean Fruits,’ 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,127,101 to 500 Dollars,"This expression is atypical for a Macallan whisky-the standard Macallan line is aged in sherry casks, while this one is aged in a bourbon cask. Absent the sherry, this isn’t as sweet or rich. Rather, it’s more delicate and gentle. The whisky is very clean and creamy, with lovely floral notes (lavender, heather, rose), intertwined with spices (especially vanilla), and fruit (baked apple, pineapple, coconut). Delicate, pleasing finish. One of the better non-sherried whiskies distilled at Macallan. (Bottled exclusively for retailer Wine on the 9.)",
"Glenkinchie Distillers Edition 1996, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Straw gold color. A very aromatic whisky, with dry, delicate herbal, floral notes. Light and soft in body. Gentle on the palate-delicately sweet and fruity up front, then becoming dry with herbal, spice notes. 
",
"Oban Distillers Edition 1996, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,77,0 to 100 Dollars,"Pale gold color. Aromatic, floral, herbal aromas (a veritable potpourri), with soft background vanilla malt notes and a hint of lemon. Light and soft in body. Soft, malty vanilla notes on the palate with interwoven notes of herbs, subtle dried fruit, and delicate wood resins. Gently dry finish. 
",
"Balblair 1989, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,94,0 to 100 Dollars,"Thick barley and viscous, with ever-present brine and berried fruit throughout. Underlying notes of waxy fruit (no doubt from some sherry cask aging), clementine, pineapple, and black licorice emerge, followed by the brine kicking in again towards the finish. The most rambunctious of the three.",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Blair Athol) 22 year old 1989, 50.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Golden bronze Aroma: Syrupy. Honey. Fruit gum drops. Anise. Spearmint. Palate: Thick, viscous, surupy. Honey up front, then becoming dry through to the end, with notes of dried fruit, mint, and oak. 
",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Auchentoshan) 13 year old 1998, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,66,0 to 100 Dollars,"Very thick in texture and mouthcoating -- almost chewy -- with ripe barley, shortbread cookies, and honey up front. Dried vanilla, violet, cinnamon, and bright fruit notes emerge mid-palate. The dried spices and moderate oak tannins linger on the finish, contrasting the whisky’s rich, sweet entry. If this whisky were a road, there would be a lot of hills.",
"Bruichladdich Islay Barley 5 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,84,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"A tamed Talisker. The classic Talisker personality shows-seaweed, brine, peat smoke, and freshly ground pepper on the finish. There are even other interesting flavors I enjoy, notably vanilla, licorice root, charcoal, and bitter chocolate. But this whisky needs to be a little livelier to be a truly great whisky. While there’s no age statement, there’s older whisky in here for sure, and maybe that’s part of its “reserved” nature. It certainly is a nice whisky, but I would prefer the more vibrant Talisker 18 year old -at two-thirds the cost. 
",
"Douglas Laing Old & Rare (distilled at Littlemill) 20 year old, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,246,101 to 500 Dollars,"An interesting application of Macallan, aged originally in a bourbon cask and then in Ridge Zinfandel barrels. Quite sweet and full-flavored, with ripe, jammy fruit, beach plum, subtle (yet deep) toffee, and grape skin, all laced with honey. Dynamic, fun, and carefree.",
"Double Barrel Talisker/Craigellachie, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,49,0 to 100 Dollars,"Quite nutty (especially the latter half of the palate), with chewy toffee, vanilla fudge, subtle fruit, and leafy smoke. I like the texture of this whisky. Quite satisfying. An improvement over the distillery-bottled 10 year old, which I suggested (Vol. 16, No. 2) needed to reach its teens to begin to fully develop. This whisky validates my theory. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)
",
"Port Ellen 32 year old, 52.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,952,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Aged on the Scottish mainland for 14 years and then finished off in sherry casks on the Island of Mull. A fresh whisky with a hint of brine, along with richer nutty toffee and chocolate fudge, embedded with dried fruit. Delicate oak resin peppers the finish, balancing the whisky’s sweetness. One of the best unpeated Tobermory whiskies (i.e. non-Ledaig) whiskies I’ve tasted. The sherry enhances the whiskey without dominating.
",
"Balblair 2002, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,63,0 to 100 Dollars,"Fruit is the common thread to this lightly peated whisky; red fruit, that is. Red raspberry, red currant, red seedless grape, strawberry, and red apple. A gentle sweetness (creamy vanilla, light molasses) balances all this fruit. Not overly contemplative, but delightful. This is definitely  not the same Rocks I reviewed two years ago. It is richer, darker in color, and tastes more mature. It's an improved version, and my rating reflects this.",
"Balblair 1996, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"If you’re looking for a bold, dry, spicy Speysider, this is the one. There’s lots of oak here, with bourbon undertones. A fighting vanilla sweetness manages to keep the whisky from becoming too austere. Gritty texture, with cedar wood, clove, spearmint, anise, herbal notes, dried fruit, and dark chocolate. A whisky that awakens the palate. Very invigorating. (Exclusive to The Whisky Exchange, London.)  Price: approximately $100. 
",
"Auld Reekie, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"Aged exclusively in first-fill casks (60% of it sherry cask), and its oak intensity shows. Sweet, but with a steady dose of dried spice, oak resin, and teasing tobacco to back it up. Silky texture and lush, with fallen orchard fruit, tangerine, chocolate-covered orange, and lemon meringue. A firm dried spice finish rounds it all out. Sort of like The Dalmore 12 year old pumped up on steroids.",
"Elements of Islay Br4 (distilled at Bruichladdich), 54.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"What a surprise! Really thick and malty for a blend (there’s a high malt content here for sure), and also nicely mature for 8 years old. Great balance too, with the island aggressiveness tamed by a rich, malty elegance. Delicious honey, toasted oak, firm peat, dark chocolate, and glazed citrus meld nicely with the malt, leading to a honeyed, lightly-peppered finish. Very enjoyable.",
"Glenglassaugh Evolution, 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"Deeper and darker when compared to its younger siblings, but with the same personality. Drier, especially on the finish, with added oak resin, espresso, leather, and tobacco. Bonus points for character.
",
"Arran 12 year old Cask Strength, 53.6%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Good weight to this blend. Creamy and mouth-coating on the palate, with a nice malty, honey-tinged backbone. Bright fruitabounds, with golden raisin, lemon meringue, peach, and a hint of pineapple. Notes of creamy vanilla and gently nutty, through to its soft finish. 
",
"Highland Park Einar, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,68,0 to 100 Dollars,"The fourth release of peated Edradour whisky. This time it’s aged in oloroso sherry casks. There’s a lot going on in this whisky. Yeah, it’s still a little on the young side, but what it lacks in maturity is compensated by a dynamic youthful complexity. A distinctive whisky, with coal tar, damp kiln smoke, caramelized fruit, smoked almond, walnut, licorice stick, and maple-cured bacon. Youthful, sweet, smoky, lingering finish. I’m looking forward to future releases. (6,000 bottles released, but only 900 to the U.S.). 
",
"Tullibardine 500 Sherry, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"The second generation of The Spice Tree. (This new expression sports a much larger tree image on the front label.) While the first bottling used inner French oak staves to impart additional oak influence, this one uses French oak barrel heads. This new bottling is also bolder, displaying more oak -- there are more dried spice notes and it’s more viscous and clinging on the palate. (It’s also less elegant than the original bottling.) Notes of sticky toffee, vanilla fudge, bramble, and red currant give way to oak resin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and subtle lemongrass. A tactile, somewhat resinous, polished leather finish wraps it up. A nice whisky, but I really enjoy the subtler, more elegant nature of the original bottling better.",
"The Glenrothes “John Ramsay,” 46.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,1000,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Deeper, richer, more viscous, and more intriguing than the 12 year old (and not as sappy as the 18 year old). Complex and intriguing, with raisin, orange marmalade, grape skin, sugar plum, cinnamon bun, raspberry preserve, mixed nuts, and coal ash. Nice tannic grip on the finish. The best of the bunch, and very impressive!",
"Tomatin Legacy, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"Similar to the Classic in its tropical fruit and honeyed vanilla, but with more depth, emerging nuts, and dried spice. Thicker too—with a slightly oily texture. A noticeable improvement from the Classic. This 12 year old is worth the few extra bucks. It’s the most rounded and balanced of the three new whiskies.",
"Sir Edward’s 12 year old Blended Whisky, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,22,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured exclusively in ex-bourbon barrels (American white oak, or quercus alba), and certified kosher. It’s a softer, gentler version of Glenrothes. The bourbon oak influence is very evident, showing creamy vanilla and coconut, with additional fruit (orange creamsicle, pineapple, black raspberry, blueberry, and gooseberry). Soft, creamy vanilla finish. A pleasant, easy-going, seamless dram—and perhaps the most approachable Glenrothes whisky.",
"The Macallan 1961 Vintage, 54.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,1000,501 to 1000 Dollars,"A very richly textured Glenrothes. A heavy, honeyed maltiness provides the foundation of this whisky, with interwoven candied fruit notes (orange, tangerine, sultana), red and black licorice, toffee, and toasted almonds. Dry, spicy, oak notes balance its sweetness and provide depth. What impresses me most about this whisky is how it evolves on the palate and continues evolving through its lengthy finish. 
",
"Bruichladdich Octomore 6.1 5 year old, 57%",Single Malt Scotch,84,161,101 to 500 Dollars,"Springbank’s tasting room bottling of its triple-distilled malt will not disappoint any fan of the official bottling; all its rounded and honeyed characteristics are firmly in evidence here. The nose is soft and sweet, with praline and a touch of condensed sweet malt joining creamed vanilla. Without water, the malt is surprisingly robust and prickly. Dilute it, though, and it’s a very pleasant drink, with crystallized grapefruit, traces of hickory and menthol, some honey, and sweet candy. Later on, spice comes through, and the finish is long, fruity, and spicy. An interesting take, but not a radical departure from the official bottling. ",
"Wemyss Malts Spiced Chocolate Cup (distilled at Clynelish) 1997, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,108,101 to 500 Dollars,"Without water, this is an aggressive malt, sharp and acerbic. With water, it’s still more in your face than any official bottling. Where you tend to associate Caol Ila with oily, peaty, and maritime characteristics, this is altogether more feisty and ballsier, with a glance to the big three peaty distilleries in the south of Islay, and even a nod to its peppery cousin on Skye. On the nose there is peat, but it is tempered by dark chocolate; some citrus there, too. The taste is quite sharp, with bitter lemon, licorice, and sooty peat to the fore. Certainly an interesting take on this intriguing distillery, and far removed from last year’s relatively gentle 25 year old release, but there are questions over the balance, and whether it’s a better whisky is a moot point. ",
"Auchentoshan Virgin Oak, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"This distillery-only bottling strips away the sweet gloopiness of the standard 12 year old — and is all the better for that. The nose is soft and gentle, with rose petals and rose hips over a base of ripe plum and a touch of ginger cake. The palate is intriguing and holds the attention, with citrus fruits, bitter apple, spice, and a touch of peppermint. It is all very clean, sophisticated, and pleasant. The finish is long and warming, and the overall experience is highly enjoyable. Justified as a distillery-only bottling? Without a doubt. ",
"Cadenhead’s (distilled at Littlemill) 36 year old, 40.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,282,101 to 500 Dollars,"The newest member of the ever-expanding range hailing from Gordon & MacPhail’s own distillery in Forres. This example has been aged in port pipes — and it shows immediately on the nose. Benromach is a teasing mid-weight Speysider, and this has added depth of sweet damson jam-like aromas mixed with Seville orange (marmalade) and some milky nut. Rich fruitcake flavors on the tongue. This is a very well balanced and precocious 12 year old. Worth a look.",
"Royal Salute The Diamond Tribute, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,270,101 to 500 Dollars,"Named in honor of the early Portuguese explorers, this newest Glenfiddich expression has spent a lengthy period of secondary maturation in Madeira drums. This has given a rich sweet fruitiness — think blueberry muffins mixed with moss alongside date, fig, and black grape. The palate is sweet and smooth with a pickup of gingery spices toward the finish. Well balanced and quite a departure. (Travel Retail exclusive, not available in the U.S.) £75",
"Master of Malt Boxes Blend, 40.9%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"The latest in this Perthshire distillery’s ongoing Port Cask series of releases has been wholly matured in a bodega port butt since being distilled in 2003. The nose is fragrant, featuring summer berries and glacé cherries, while the palate suggests canned pineapple with cream, contrasting with red wine notes. The finish is quite lengthy, with raspberries, spicy oak, and a whiff of smoke. ",
"Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Tormore) 1988, 64.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,150,101 to 500 Dollars,"A Glen Ord bottled by the London wine and spirits establishment of Milroy’s, and a relatively rare opportunity to sample single malt from this Diageo-owned distillery. The nose initially presents lemon zest, then peaches and caramel, with cream soda notes. Very fruity and lively in the mouth, with a nutty, malty undercurrent. Medium in length; firm, with spicy fruit lasting to the very end, accompanied by a touch of well-mannered fresh oak. £45 Currently not available in the U.S.",
"Glen Moray Mastery, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,92,1000,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The first release in Glenmorangie’s new Vintage Collection, named Bond House No.1 after the 19th century warehouse that became the distillery’s new stillhouse in 1990. Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Mandarins, honey, and vanilla on the floral nose. Very smooth on the palate, with malt, vanilla, more honey, and milk chocolate orange. Attractive soft oak notes and gentle herbal spice in the medium to long finish.",
"Adelphi (distilled at Longmorn) 1985, 49.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,320,101 to 500 Dollars,"Distinctively pale in color. (A hint of its age?) This annual limited edition release is finally available in the U.S. Youthful, vibrant, and thumping, with the sea flowing through its veins. Coal tar, peat smoke, brine, seaweed, bright fruit (pear, tangerine), and soft vanilla all compete for attention. The only thing holding me back from scoring it higher is that it comes across as a bit too youthful.",
"Tomatin, 40 year old, 1967 vintage, 42.9%",Single Malt Scotch,91,1000,501 to 1000 Dollars,"The whisky begins sweet and creamy, with notes of vanilla, honey, and ripe malt (reminiscent of a malting floor). Then the Laphroaig signature peat smoke, seaweed, tar, and medicinal notes emerge. Bottling at 48% and without chill-filtering keeps the whisky from being dulled down. A whisky that is very dynamic. Nicely done.",
"Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Glen Grant) 1992, 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,127,101 to 500 Dollars,"Exclusively for the U.S. as an addition between the 10 and the 17 year old. Central to its composition is a ‘parcel’ of refill hogsheads, to which a number of European oak butts have been added. Initially slightly herbal on the nose, with developing fresh fruits and vanilla. Finally, caramel and damp leaves underfoot. Full and confident on the palate, with tropical fruits, stem ginger, and hazelnuts. Drying in the finish, with spicy, rich oak and creamy allspice.",
"Glenfarclas Family Casks 1983 (Cask #31), 46.1%",Single Malt Scotch,84,724,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Selected by distillery manager Douglas Campbell, currently in his 50th year at Tomatin. It has been matured in a combination of American and European oak casks, and just 200 cases have been released. Citrus fruits on the nose, notably oranges, and apricots, with a hint of damp soil. More fruit on the palate, orange wine gums, ginger, and gentle oak. Long and slowly drying in the finish, with encroaching aniseed and tannins. ",
"Bowmore Mizunara Cask Finish, 53.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,1000,501 to 1000 Dollars,"Just eight whiskies in the blend, married and finished in first fill Spanish sherry and bourbon casks. An insistent nose, crackling with spices, with toasted Eccles cake anointed with grated nutmeg, vanilla extract, cassia, and dark soy sauce. Light honey and vanilla, tangerine oils, and lime peel exhibit perfectly-paced development, with flavor building over a minute or more. Warming ginger, spices, and tropical fruits of guava and papaya close out this first annual special edition. Impressive work.",
"Exclusive Malts 1993 (distilled at Glen Garioch), 52.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"The 11 year old triple distilled Lowland single malt in this bottling has been matured entirely in French oak casks that previously contained Bordeaux wine, then bottled at cask strength. The nose offers contrasting sweet and sour fruit notes, red grapes and gooseberries, damp newspaper, warm stone, and vanilla. Herbal, with cloves and spearmint. Mouth-coating, bittersweet on the palate, with molasses and — inevitably — red wine. Dark chocolate, raisins, and aniseed in the drying finish.",
"Wemyss Malts Lead on Macduff! 2002 (distilled at Macduff), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,96,0 to 100 Dollars,"Tullibardine has been offering a 1988 vintage edition for several years, but in 2011 it bottled a new variant at 23 years of age, matured in a mixture of first-fill bourbon barrels and ex-sherry hogsheads. Malt, vanilla, carnations, and peaches on the full nose. The palate is initially sweet and fruity, with toffee, lively spices, and more herbal notes duly appearing. The finish features cereal, spice, and white chocolate. £47",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular 1996 (distilled at Highland Park), 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,151,101 to 500 Dollars,"Wemyss Malts names the sources of these single cask bottlings for the first time in the series. ‘Caribbean Fruits’ is a 1990 Glencadam. The hogshead in which it was matured has yielded just 320 bottles. Sweet on the nose, with apricots, fudge, creamy vanilla, and drinking chocolate. Tropical fruits on the palate, with malt, hazelnuts, and spicy oak. Tannins and cocoa powder in the finish. £80",
"Master of Malt Secret Bottlings Series 8 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,35,0 to 100 Dollars,"Amontillado casks are used here, which add a certain almond-like note to the nose, as well as more obvious oakiness. The effect is a general deepening and lengthening of aroma and flavor. The dry notes have gone, replaced by a sweeter and more generous palette of flavors. The fresh meadow flowers are more like cut flowers in a florist shop, the fruits hint toward peach, and there’s a new citric burst on the finish.",
"Benrinnes 21 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 56.9%",Single Malt Scotch,84,400,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is clearly Oban. Time in Montilla fino casks hasn’t diminished the fresh fruitiness. The orange zestiness has also been retained. Like the ‘Kinchie, what the finish has done is allow the palate to thicken out and show what seems like a more mature personality. A new heavy floral note emerges. All in all, there is greater concentration and ripeness with an added ginger note. Another edition that improves on the original.",
"Strathmill 25 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 52.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,475,101 to 500 Dollars,"The third and final release of the 1989 vintage of Northern Highland malt Balblair is on sale in Europe initially, with U.S. availability (at approximately $95) this fall. Initially quite reticent on the nose, with a hint of potato chips, mild vanilla, lemon, and unripe bananas. Full and rounded on the palate; nutty, with tropical fruits and lively spice. Medium length in the finish, with apricots, instant coffee, and milky cocoa. £60",
"Kilchoman Single Cask Release Cask #370 (distilled 2008, bottled 2014), 59.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,95,0 to 100 Dollars,"New to Duncan Taylor’s Dimensions range is this single cask (#2927), cask strength offering from Perthshire’s Blair Athol distillery. Sweet and fruity on the nose, majoring in tinned pineapple in syrup. Toffee, nougat, and a hint of freshly-dug soil make up the supporting aromatic cast. Full bodied and initially as sweet in the mouth as it was on the nose, with vigorous spices, particularly nutmeg, then it begins to dry. The long finish is characterized by powdery cocoa and oak tannins. £80",
"Cuatro Series Fino, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Another recent addition to Aberdeenshire bottler Duncan Taylor’s Dimensions range, launched late last year. The nose is very fruity, with sliced peaches and apricots, plus a porridge-like background note. Relatively full bodied and malty, with intense fruit notes, then dark spices appear. The finish is medium in length, spicy with aniseed balls, then a lingering creaminess at the very end. £42",
"Highland Park Dark Origins, 46.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"Since its reopening eleven years ago this year, Bruichladdich has been growing barley on Islay—a laudable move. This glimpse into the developing program shows what seems initially to be a delicately fragile dram that soon reveals an intense sweet depth behind the spring flowers. This purity of intent continues on the palate with a thick creaminess that’s typical of the distillery, while a tart finish adds interest. Precocious, but already beautifully balanced. £38",
"Cadenhead Authentic Collection 28 year old (distilled at Highland Park), 48.3%",Single Malt Scotch,84,191,101 to 500 Dollars,"As with Rosebank, Douglas Laing & Co. Ltd. has made a habit of releasing single malts from the now-demolished distillery of Littlemill, which formerly stood not far from Auchentoshan. The latest variant was distilled in November 1991 and bottled early in 2012. The nose is fresh and fruity, with vanilla and boiled sweets. Sweetly spicy on the straightforward palate, with ginger to the fore. Spice continues through the finish, with a hint of cedar. £157",
"Grant’s Signature, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,29,0 to 100 Dollars,"We don't see very much Craigellachie as a single malt because most of it goes into blending, and from that we might draw the conclusion that it's not particularly distinctive in its own right. If it plays a role in this mix it's a submissive one then, because after a not altogether enticing nose that has gooseberry, green salad, and some prickly chili pepper, the palate is all about a mouth-coating big pepper hit that stays long into the finish. €40",
"Highland Queen 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,76,0 to 100 Dollars,"A mix of two types of cask, both refill. Typical Port Ellen on the nose, very clean, precise, and austere, hiding its sweetness in a new pigskin wallet. Though there are hints of apple and almond, it has a chalky edge and surprisingly low levels of smoke. With water there’s squid ink and waxed paper. The palate starts with Darjeeling tea and roasted fruits, then heads to the kelp-strewn seashore. As challenging as ever, and actually a bit too dry. £600",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at North British) Batch 1, 51.1%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,76,0 to 100 Dollars,"This 2002 expression of Balblair replaces the previous 2001 vintage as the ‘entry level’ bottling. It is naturally colored and non-chill filtered, in line with the rest of the Balblair range, and has been matured in bourbon barrels. Fizzy lemonade, banana skins, and violets on the nose, with soft caramel developing in time. Fruit and nut milk chocolate on the palate, with ripe apples and vanilla. Long, floral, and lively in the finish. £40",
"Bowmore 37 year old 1968 vintage, 43.4%",Single Malt Scotch,85,1000,501 to 1000 Dollars,"New in 2016, this is an NAS entry-level bottling for the brand, matured in bourbon barrels before spending a finishing period in oloroso sherry butts. Sweet and malty on the nose, a hint of mash, then pineapple. Becoming more floral, with violets. The palate offers soft fruit notes, cocoa powder, light sherry, and mixed nuts. The finish is medium in length, with milky coffee and soft spices.",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Craigellachie) 18 year old, 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,123,101 to 500 Dollars,"The old name for Edinburgh has been hijacked for use on this mix of Islay malts, and appropriate it is. The creosote, damp outbuilding, and oily rope nose is distinctive and strong, the peat pronounced in the taste, though gooseberry, green melon, and a trace of kumquat are also in the mix, and there's pepper in there too. But ultimately the peat holds out and brings up the finish. ",
"Glenmorangie Dornoch Limited Edition, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,92,0 to 100 Dollars,"More from Bruichladdich. The latest in the Elements series is clean in a freshly-showered kind of fashion. The fact that it’s backed up with bran, agave syrup, and pancake batter just helps to emphasize this image of a sunlit breakfast. The palate is sweet, fat, and juicy, typical of how texture is as important as flavor with the Laddie. In time there’s some cinnamon with a preserved lemon acidity that enlivens the finish. £55 (500 ml)",
"Glenmorangie Taghta, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,99,0 to 100 Dollars,"Following on from Revival, Glenglassaugh has released 6,000 bottles of Evolution, an expression also made after the distillery’s reopening in 2008. It has been matured in first-fill George Dickel barrels and bottled at cask strength. Peaches and gingerbread on the nose, with brittle toffee, icing sugar, and vanilla. Luscious soft fruits dipped in caramel figure on the palate, with coconut and background stem ginger. The finish is medium in length, with spicy toffee.  £50",
"Wemyss Malts Cayenne Cocoa Bean 1997 (distilled at Clynelish), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,104,101 to 500 Dollars,"This is the second batch of Arran 12 year old in cask strength format, and it contains a higher percentage of sherry cask-matured whisky than the first. The out-turn is just over 13,000 bottles. Fresh and sweet on the nose after an initial note of resin, with oats and hot butter. Full-bodied, syrupy and sweet on the palate, with apricots, ripe bananas, nutmeg, and walnuts. The finish majors in plain chocolate, maraschino cherries, and a suggestion of smoky sherry. ",
"Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Deanston, Cask 10,426) 1994, 51.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,133,101 to 500 Dollars,"Einar was joint Earl of Orkney from 1014, and this bottling moves the Warrior Series slightly further into familiar Highland Park territory. Some gentle smoke on the nose, with fresh newsprint, ginger, caramel, and a hint of halibut oil. Peat smoke, vanilla, and citrus fruit on the palate. A little peat smoke in the medium-length finish. €53/liter",
"Arran Machrie Moor Cask Strength (Batch 1), 58.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"Finished principally in Pedro Ximenez Spanish sherry casks, Tullibardine 500 Sherry has a fragrant nose, with new leather, beeswax, apple, and vanilla. The palate is smooth and sherried, with more leather, brittle toffee, orange peel, honey, and nutmeg. The fruity finish is notably spicy, with lingering wood polish notes. ",
"Syndicate 58/6 Premium, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Cardhu—for me, at least—means intensity, and this delivers precisely that, with masses of
citrus (bergamot and grapefruit) and just a hint of dark chocolate behind. With
water, there’s red apple and Victoria plum, while the mouth is precise, with
any richness cut with fresh acidity. Zesty and fresh on the finish. Try it in a
Bobby Burns. Released without any fanfare, here’s evidence that Cardhu’s
rebuilding its reputation nicely. £66",
"Label 5 Gold Heritage, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"Tomatin Legacy has been matured in a combination of bourbon and virgin oak casks, and after an initial release in Europe, worldwide availability will follow. Honey and malt on the nose, melons; fragrant and mildly herbal. White pepper and ultimately a whiff of treacle. Fresh and lively on the sweet, fruity palate, with tinned pineapple, cake mix, and more pepper. Quite dry in the medium length finish, with a suggestion of chili. £26",
"Wemyss Malts Velvet Fig, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,61,0 to 100 Dollars,"A very different whisky to its unaged namesake, and most unlike any of the other blends tasted for this issue. That’s no bad thing.
This is less sweet than most blends, with tobacco leaf and ashtray to the fore, and a dusty, grainy note with a touch of oak, grape skin, and sweet heather. That said, not a lot of evidence of the 12 years in cask.",
"Mackillop’s Choice (distilled at Tormore) 1988, 55.6%",Single Malt Scotch,84,183,101 to 500 Dollars,"I have a soft spot for the Braes: not only a forgotten part of Speyside, but the only distillery whose roof I’ve stood on. Anyway, here you have yeastiness and a smell like just-baked, sugar-topped apple pie, the fruit cracking through warm pastry. Sweet, direct, and slightly nervy, Braes is never going to be a heavy hitter, but this is the ideal dram to conjure up fading memories of summer.",
"Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Caol Ila) 6 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,73,0 to 100 Dollars,"Smoke comes at you immediately, the morning-after smoke of a spent fire, mixing with reeds and rushes, a touch of coconut, and light oak. Water is needed to bring out sweetness alongside the Band-Aid note typical of many young peaty whiskies. The palate is a lot sweeter than the nose suggests, bold and quite thick; honey adding a sticky quality that then moves into creosote and antiseptic cream. It needs hefty degrees of dilution. A work in progress. £100",
"Tomatin 12 year old French Oak Finish, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"This single cask bottling of Clynelish from Wemyss Malts is 16 years old, and just 302 bottles were yielded by the bourbon hogshead in which maturation took place. Milk chocolate, orange, and malt on the nose; fragrant, with stem ginger. Zesty and notably spicy on the palate, with applesauce, peaches, and digestive biscuits. Relatively long in the finish, with oak, allspice, and persistent fruitiness.£67",
"Tomatin, 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,81,0 to 100 Dollars,"Morrison Bowmore distillers has recently released a virgin oak-matured expression of its Auchentoshan single malt, which has no age statement. The North American oak casks have been charred prior to receiving this Lowland whisky as their first fillings. The result is a nose of Madeira, cinnamon, vanilla, and white pepper. Very spicy on the palate, with citrus fruits and plain chocolate. Lingering in the finish, with cocoa powder, icing sugar; becoming slightly more bitter with time.",
"Talisker Skye, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,48,0 to 100 Dollars,"Cadenhead is responsible for this veteran cask strength release distilled in 1977 at the now-demolished distillery of Littlemill, located a couple of miles from Auchentoshan. The nose is sweet, with icing sugar, vanilla, honey, and peaches. Damp grass after a while. Initially sweet and full on the palate, slightly resinous, with marzipan and sherbet, then quite bitter oak kicks in. The marzipan and tannins fight it out in the finish. £175",
"Glen Turner Heritage Double Wood, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,20,0 to 100 Dollars,"How can you really compare this to a quality blend priced under $50? It's hard not to view this as a victory of style over substance, and I object to premium whiskies being just 40% ABV, but nevertheless this is excellently made and the blending of whiskies over 21 years is exemplary. It's rich and viscous with light peach and plum notes and a pleasant earthy base.",
"Aberlour A’Bunadh (Batch #50), 59.6%",Single Malt Scotch,84,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Master of Malt is an online whisky company that seems to try its hand at most things and is bringing a fresh irreverence to the world of whisky. This was created in partnership with the bass guitarist of British rock band Athlete, and it's rather good. Sweet and rich with toffee, orange chocolate, and honey, it's another blend with a lot to say for itself.  £55",
"Douglas Laing Single Minded Speyside 24 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,125,101 to 500 Dollars,"There’s something rather round peg in a square hole about Tormore, that grand urban palace of a distillery in wildest Speyside. The whisky, sadly, is often the same. Here, though, things look promising to start with: rice crackers, and a spicy, rye-like hardness on top of a vanilla-accented, sweet trail mix of a nose with some earthiness behind. The palate, for me, is still too rigid. For all its efforts to relax, this Tormore remains tense. £90",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glenallachie) 6 year old, 52.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,84,0 to 100 Dollars,"This year’s Ardbeg Day bottling is named in tribute to World Cup host Brazil’s national colors: Auri (Gold) and Verdes (Green). Very restrained to start: grassy, sweet with vanilla pod, shoreline, and smoke wrapped in a woolen blanket. The palate shows more smoke, light chocolate, Ardbeg oiliness, and soot. It’s fresh and charming, but ultimately is a quarterfinalist beaten on penalties.",
"Hart Brothers 11 year old (distilled at Bowmore), 55.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"Plenty of the distillery’s fresh fruits, here with some Demerara sugar sprinkled on the top, a little hint of almond, peppermint, candied apple, and hard fruit sweets. The palate continues in the same vein, with some more apple (baked this time) and a chalky texture. Water allows it to become more creamy (think orange barley water), while a green fresh note emerges in the background. Just slightly bitter behind.",
"Laphroaig 15 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"What you look for in a finished whisky is for some of the distillery's character to be apparent, but also enhanced. Benrinnes is a big, meaty dram, which suits sherry and its feral aspect is there. Think of roast beef with damson jam, date, and blackberry. The palate is thick with licorice sweetness and a bitter edge. It has power, and while you can see the join between original spirit and finish, it’s a pretty happy match. £60/500 ml",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Arran) 2006, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"The initial nose is soft fruits doused in condensed milk, which contributes to an overall impression of light toffee and, weirdly for this distillery in its contemporary guise, some smoke. The fruits manage to mix the ripe and slightly sour. Quite intense; it needs water, which calms proceedings allowing typical Glen Grant purity to come through. The fruits now have some added weight and, again, that smokiness. Intriguing! £75",
"Glen Scotia Double Cask, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,58,0 to 100 Dollars,"In style, this is closest to the 1978 in its levels of sweetness. Here, though, there is added key lime pie, juicy white peaches, and whipped cream alongside that deep Glenfarclas roasted ‘polished brass’ note. The medium-weight palate is pure and sweet with light orchard fruits. The most freshly acidic of the selection, with a hint of flowers on the very end. £430",
"The Antiquary 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,27,0 to 100 Dollars,"Pale straw. Delicate and a little akin to chilled manzanilla sherry: fresh almond, salinity, light yeast. Vibrant, with the smoke held in check. The palate is much sweeter, with finally some cask-derived sugars beginning to show. Then it rushes to the shoreline and takes a gulp of water, giving an effect like saltwater taffy. It needs water to flesh the palate out. £60/500 ml",
"Cadenhead’s (distilled at Caol Ila) 1984, 50.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,400,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 19 year old example of Glen Garioch from 1993 offers a nose of orange blossom, sherry, and milk chocolate, becoming sweeter with time. Finally, butterscotch mousse. Sweet and fruity on the palate, with cherries, icing sugar, and a hint of smoky caramel. Medium to long in the finish, with persistent citrus notes, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. (U.S. only)",
"Dalwhinnie Winter’s Gold, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,58,0 to 100 Dollars,"While most Wemyss Malts’ releases are named after flavor descriptors, this one adopts a well-known Shakespearean reference. A sherry butt filled in 2002 gave an out-turn of 854 bottles. The nose offers toffee bonbons, coffee with condensed milk, and finally farmyard aromas. The palate is relatively sweet, with spicy sherry notes and contrasting mildly citric fruit, plus a slight earthiness. The finish is medium to long, with lingering spice and a carry-over of coffee from the nose. £57",
"MacPhail’s Collection (distilled at Glenturret) 2000, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,60,0 to 100 Dollars,"This 17 year old single cask (#10042) bottling of Highland Park was distilled in September 1996 and is presented non-chill filtered and with no added color in Douglas Laing’s Old Particular range. Baked cereal and peeled apples on the peaty nose, while dark, smoky notes contrast with lighter, fruity flavors on the palate, along with a sprinkling of pepper. The finish dries, with more pepper, bonfire embers, and coffee grounds. £90",
"Tomatin Contrasting Casks Bourbon Matured, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,152,101 to 500 Dollars,"Master of Malt has accumulated quite a trophy cabinet for their work on blends. The nose is inviting, with butter toffee, Bramley apples, fennel seeds, cut lawns, and chocolate-covered oat biscuits. It’s a pretty smooth proposition, serving up caramel maltiness, stewed apple, and orange and grapefruit pith, with just a hint of sharp lemon freshness to open up with. The ginger finish is zappy but short. A solid, everyday blend.",
"Cadenhead’s (distilled at Glentauchers) 1989, 55.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,275,101 to 500 Dollars,"Meaty, beaty, big, but only slightly bouncy. The nose is initially reminiscent of curried mutton with an added heathery earthiness and some distillery sulfur. It then dries into biltong/pemmican with some faint barley notes behind. The water adds a note of fresh coriander. Massive in the mouth, with raisin, roasting tins. It’s a relief when water releases some surprisingly soft treacle toffee sweetness, but it’s not quite enough to balance the massive meaty assault. (2,892 bottles)",
"The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 1997 17 year old (Cask #5365), 60.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,1008,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Light gold. Fresh and lightly nutty/biscuity combined with a gently swelling aroma of fruit syrups, green grape, lime (or green) jelly babies, and Quetsch, with that nut flour underneath. The palate is similarly smooth, creamy, and upfront, with a decidedly acidic zing to the finish before the wood finally shows its presence. A soft, delicious whisky that ticks all the right boxes but doesn’t really set the world alight. (2,700 bottles)",
"Bowmore The Devil’s Casks III, 56.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,274,101 to 500 Dollars,"An uncommon exclusive bottling of a 6 year old cask strength malt. Light gold in color, the nose is vegetal, more peat bog than peat smoke, with an undercurrent of pastry cream and rose. It’s an odd combination of aromas. The entry is flavorful and inviting with smoked pineapple, clove, and rose. Peak smoke arrives in full force in the mid-palate, which drops the sweet and becomes spicy. The finish is mostly smoke, but with a pleasant minty coolness.  (Wyoming only)",
"Aberfeldy 16 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"The nose is nutty and earthy, with dry sherry, cooking apples, vanilla, and emerging icing sugar. Finally, a hint of sea salt. Silky in the mouth, with lively spices, Jaffa oranges, muted sherry, and mixed nuts. The finish is medium in length, nutty, with spice and persistent citrus fruit.",
"Kilchoman Sanaig, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"Dark Origins is a new addition to Highland Park’s core range, inspired by the distillery’s founder, Magnus Eunson. The recipe embraces twice as many first-fill sherry casks than that of Highland Park 12 year old. Chocolate malt, caramel, and ripe bananas on the nose, with a whiff of coal dust. Silky on the palate, with dry sherry, autumn berries, plus more coal and a spicy, plain chocolate edge. Long and dry in the smoky finish, with black pepper.",
"Port Charlotte 2007 CC:01, 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,98,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distilled in 1985, this expression of Highland Park was matured in a single bourbon cask that yielded 252 bottles. Green apples, tinned mandarin oranges, linseed, and a hint of smoky chocolate on the nose. Sweet spices, coconut, and mild peat smoke on the light palate. Lingering peat smoke, root ginger, and a touch of vanilla in the medium-length finish. £120",
"Glen Grant 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,56,0 to 100 Dollars,"Brian Kinsman’s new creation was inspired by their founder William Grant, with a remit to create a malty blend of character. Digestive biscuits, malt, honeycomb, and confectioner’s chocolate melted over a bain-marie. It’s a satisfyingly rich dram, well-structured with a great mouthfeel that wanes with natural dilution. Banoffee pie, caramel biscuits, and maltiness deepen to flavors of coffee bean and molasses, leaving a teeth-coating finish of black coffee. (UK and France only) £18",
"Bunnahabhain Amontillado 16 year old, 54%",Single Malt Scotch,84,325,101 to 500 Dollars,"At this age, there are more linear displays of fruit and sweetness than the 8 year old. Behind the tarte tatin, butterscotch, light pepper, and wood spice is a green, verdant nose of wet foliage and public lawns in the morning mist. It has a light to medium-weight texture of sugary butterscotch, strawberry, and raspberry developing around an oak and malt core. When the fruit flavor withers, there is a drop off in flavor, leaving a malty melee. £48",
"Bowmore 2016 vintage Fèis Ìle, 54.9%",Single Malt Scotch,84,71,0 to 100 Dollars,"Custard creams, lemon peel, and clotted cream create easygoing aromas on this drop from the mighty Edinburgh grain distillery. The palate moves rapidly through flavors of lemon cake and lime zest, to grapefruit sharpness and fresh pineapple, reaching a plateau of sherbet and tangerine. Like a bulldog chewing a wasp, there’s lip-puckering sharpness throughout, though it’s judiciously dosed with sufficient sweetness to counterbalance it. A great introduction to the delights of the single grain category. (117 bottles) £48",
"Edradour Ballechin Sauternes Cask Matured, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,135,101 to 500 Dollars,"Big sherry influence immediately, with walnut skin, raisin bread, and mixed peels. Seems pretty dry, and the malty undertow here is whole grain bread. Balvenie’s signature sweetness comes across like soft brown Demerara sugar before it shifts into forest floor, mulch, nut, and dried berries. Just enough residual sweetness to keep the tannins at bay. Water makes it more woody, with burlap, cacao, a little earthiness, and a slightly bitter exit.",
"Glenglassaugh Octaves Classic, 44%",Single Malt Scotch,84,72,0 to 100 Dollars,"Amber. A thick nose with touches of fresh varnish and a little oiliness. Has some substance and weight and the heavy florals (lily, jasmine) typical of mature Craig, alongside toffee. The palate is ripe, juicy, and full, the cask adding a slight resinous edge. Appears slightly smoky. Becomes fleshy, even waxy, with water, and decidedly more elegant. The tannins are supple and some herbal notes emerge. It is at its best neat, or with water on the side. £80",
"Wemyss Malts Banquet of Fruits 1994 (distilled at Aberfeldy), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,131,101 to 500 Dollars,"This bottling of Glenmorangie has been released to raise awareness of marine conservation. A proportion of the whisky has been finished in amontillado sherry butts. The nose offers honey, vanilla, peaches, toffee bonbons, wood lacquer, sherry, and a hint of peat. Soft and elegant on the palate, with fruity spice, nutty toffee, more sherry, and sweet smoke. Slightly smoky in the finish, with soft oak, citrus fruit, and aniseed. (Travel Retail only) £60",
"Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice 1999 (Ledaig, distilled at Tobermory), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,78,0 to 100 Dollars,"Taghta—Gaelic for “Chosen One”—is the result of Glenmorangie’s innovative Cask Masters program, in which crowd-sourcing strongly influenced the final release. It is non-chill filtered and has been finished in manzanilla sherry casks. Fragrant, slightly salty, fruity sherry notes, sweet spices on the nose. New leather and lots of spice on the palate, with olives, rock salt, and a suggestion of red wine. Medium in length, drying, with licorice and black pepper. (12,000 bottles) £65",
"BenRiach Peated Quarter Casks, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,81,0 to 100 Dollars,"One of two single cask bottlings of 17 year old Clynelish released by Wemyss Malts in the fall of 2014. The hogshead provided 373 bottles. Pineapple and nectarines on the nose, with salted caramel. Mildly herbal. The palate is rich and viscous, with a sprinkling of pepper over sliced red apples, sweet spices, vanilla, and hazelnuts. Lingering in the finish, with lemon; nutty and lightly oaked. £68",
"Benromach Hermitage 2007, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,84,53,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distilled in June 1994, this example of Deanston was aged for 20 years in a refill butt, which ultimately yielded 188 bottles. Quite shy on the nose, a hint of starch, gentle malt, and ginger. Shows its true colors on the palate: relatively full-bodied and sweet, with peaches and over-ripe apricots. Softly spiced. The finish is lengthy and sweet, with cocoa powder and sprightly oak. £87",
"Glenfiddich IPA Experiment, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Arran first introduced its peated Machrie Moor variant some five years ago; since then it has become a firm favorite. Late 2014 saw the appearance of the first cask strength edition of Machrie Moor, limited to 6,000 bottles. Wood smoke, warm tar, and emerging new leather on the bold nose. Sweet peat and spices on the palate, barbecue sauce, and black pepper. Long in the finish: vanilla, with sweet smoke and chili.",
"Tomatin Cabernet Sauvignon 2002, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,87,0 to 100 Dollars,"An odd non-age stated blend that uses a solera system to get a drop of the original 1958 blend into the mix. The blend is then finished for four years in oloroso casks. It's a bit of blending gymnastics. Very sherry influenced, with marionberry jam, malt, salt, and oak. The integration and flavors are nice, but it all feels a bit muted. A medium length and dry finish shows off some of the younger spirit in the mix. (U.S. only)",
"Tomatin Caribbean Rum 2007, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"Master blender Graham Coull hand-selected a variety of aged stock and cask types for this new global addition to the Label 5 range. Vanilla, dark fruit, and gentle spices on the nose, but the appeal lies in the beautiful, clingy mouthfeel. Warm marmalade, nuts, and oak flavors with whispers of cinnamon and clove combine to produce a creamy, smooth dram. It builds and builds but never feels like it fully arrives. The finish is drying with dampened-down spices. €40",
"Hepburn’s Choice (distilled at Blair Athol) 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,56,0 to 100 Dollars,"Who could refuse a blend of single malts wholly matured in oloroso sherry casks? They’ve perfectly bottled the aroma of molten tiffin: the chocolate, cocoa, biscuit, raisin, dried dates, and walnut are all here. Sipping brings on chocolate, coffee, malt, ginger, nutmeg, and dried fig. There’s no slow reveal, it pretty much lays its cards on the table immediately; rather than developing flavors, they extinguish one, by one leaving a finish of cocoa and maltiness. (6,000 bottles) £40",
"Tullibardine Custodians’ Release 1970, 40.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,1900,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Full gold. Good cask interaction here, allowing a light tropical fruit element to emerge alongside peach and apricot. Juicy and sweet, in other words, with none of the usual Tormore rigidity. The palate is equally concentrated, showing some heat, with a decent degree of fleshy elegance. Water brings out more dry elements: brown bracken, hayloft. It begins to firm up, but it is good enough to change folks’ minds about this distillery. £125",
"Wolfburn The Kylver Series, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,81,0 to 100 Dollars,"Pale straw. This is a classic young Caol Ila, all elbows and knees. There is sweetness, but it’s counteracted by this briny edge and an aroma like firelighters in among smoldering peat. Shut your eyes and it could be mezcal. The smoke envelops the palate while you pick out edible seaweed and smoked oyster on the tongue. Very bright and would make a good aperitif/highball. £50",
"Black Bull 12 year old, 50%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"Exclusive to North America, this bottling was matured in bourbon hogsheads for 9 years, and then finished in French oak casks for a further 3 years. The casks originally contained red wine from the Bacalhoa winery. Before use by Tomatin they underwent a de-char/re-char process. Peaches, vanilla, milk chocolate, and ginger on the nutty nose, with new-mown hay. Full-bodied, with toffee apples, black pepper, and cloves. Lingering warm spices in the finish. (12,000 bottles)",
"The Lost Distillery Company Classic Selection Benachie, 43%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,43,0 to 100 Dollars,"This NAS cask strength expression of Tomatin was matured in a mix of bourbon and virgin American oak casks. The nose is sweet and fragrant, with vanilla, cinnamon, and developing coconut ice. Silky on the palate initially, softly spiced, with vanilla toffee, pears, and apples; then the spices intensify, introducing a hint of chili. Drying in the lengthy, spicy, slightly herbal finish. (282 bottles; exclusive to Robertson’s, Pitlochry, Perthshire) £55",
"That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Glentauchers) 17 year old, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,76,0 to 100 Dollars,"The latest release from Talisker is an NAS bottling which contains whisky matured in toasted and refill American oak casks. According to the distiller, this is “An easy-drinking Talisker…more approachable, but still definitely Talisker.” Certainly approachable on the nose, with tangerines, honey, and milk chocolate, before ozone and peat smoke develop. Ginger and a hint of coal tar. Medium-bodied, with citrus fruit and increasingly hot spices, though never overwhelming. Spicy peat, white pepper, and aniseed in a nutty finish. £33",
"Jamie Stewart, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,16,0 to 100 Dollars,"It’s Double Wood, Jim, but not as we know it. Here, the blend has been given a Madeira finish, presenting an appealing nose of spun sugar, golden raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg, and hazelnut. The blend has a creamy texture, with good weight to carry the flavors of orange peel, mango, and dried pineapple, leading to a zesty spark on swallowing. Wood spices, nuttiness, and lingering toffee make for a satisfying finish. The extra Madeira maturation is understated and perfectly judged.",
"John Barr Reserve, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,25,0 to 100 Dollars,"Very sweet, with thick hard toffee, stewing dates and figs, molasses, and rum raisin ice cream, before some dark chocolate, dried mint, and orange peel. The palate is a different beast. It ignites on the tongue with a burst of dried pepper flakes, beneath which are cocktail bitters: gentian calamus. It begs for water, when out comes black currant jam (very Aberlour) and a little malt. Now it’s calm and hugely drinkable, and therefore even more dangerous.",
"Johnnie Walker Red Label, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,25,0 to 100 Dollars,"Huge marzipan/almond notes greet you on the first sniff. This then moves into an aroma like crepe bandage and even a hint of ointment, then lychee and some maltiness. The palate is surprisingly feisty, with a little orange. Water brings out mash tun aromas and a pleasing whiff of sheep pens. When diluted, the palate is very pretty, with the almond returning. Easy drinking. £80",
"Trader Joe’s 8 year old Speyside, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,20,0 to 100 Dollars,"Another blast of new oak. Fat and creamy, with distinct charred elements along with stewing pineapple, banana fritters, white chocolate, suntan oil, and a melting bar of nut-filled milk chocolate. An instructive dram showing how maturity is very different from age. With water, some of the distillery finally pokes through. To be honest, it’s slightly too much for me; like overdosing on cotton candy or sugar-topped donuts. £54",
"MacQueens of Scotland 3 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,13,0 to 100 Dollars,"Brought back as a celebration of the distillery’s 200th anniversary and, in the vein of other 15 year old expressions, is somewhat restrained. Rather than big phenols there’s an aroma of lanolin, sautéed scallop, fleshy fruit, and real sweetness. The palate shoes some oozing oils and a whiff of creosote, but this is a tea party rather than a wild ceilidh. Maybe bottling at 46% would have given the drive that’s missing.",
"Murray McDavid 2010 Peatside 6 year old, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"Bottled in 2015, this expression from Arran distillery was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. Ripe apple and tinned peaches on the early nose, icing sugar, a hint of mint, and soft toffee. Lively spices and pear drops on the palate, with vanilla and cocoa. The finish is medium in length, with a twist of lemon and cocoa powder.",
"Wild Scotsman, 15 year old, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"This relatively youthful whisky was matured in bourbon barrels, before a period in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. Sweet, red berry notes on the nose, with slightly smoky vanilla and caramel. Voluptuous in the mouth, with spicy, rich sherry notes, sultanas, and ginger. Spicy sea salt and lingering sherry in the finish. £37",
"Compass Box Oak Cross, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,83,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"Thick, viscous golden syrup, digestive biscuits, and Almond Joy bars underpin some soft, peaty aromas. It’s rather an appealing combination. Satin smooth on the tongue, with lemon, lime, orange, and dried pineapple, but enough malt to keep things interesting. The finish riffs on a ripe lemon theme accompanied by spicy stardust. For the few extra bucks, the more mature component whiskies make for a richer, fuller, and more satisfying experience than The Antiquary’s red-labeled bottle.",
"Auchentoshan 16 year old, 53.7%",Single Malt Scotch,83,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"Surprisingly punchy for its age, there’s very little cask activity here, so what you get is a reduction of Caol Ila into oils (lanolin) and whiffs of the harbor (drying fishing nets) rather than overt smokiness. The palate is gentle and shy, with an unctuous feel that drifts into poached pear and light cream. Delicate, but also oozing with character. Best neat.",
"The Balvenie New Wood 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,83,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"Distilled between October and March, matured in American (first-fill and refill) and European oak casks; meant to be served ice-cold. From the freezer, concentrated aromas of pineapple, hints of honey and smoke. At room temperature, less intense fruitiness, more honey, and ginger. A syrupy mouthfeel from the freezer, with soft spices and orchard fruits. The palate is more complex at room temperature, with heathery spice, pepper, apricots, raisins, and milk chocolate. The finish yields cocoa powder and lingering spices. £38",
"Duncan Taylor 'Rarest of the Rare' (distilled at Banff), Cask #3421, 30 year old, 1975 vintage, 43.5%",Single Malt Scotch,83,225,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 2000 vintage expression from Glenturret was matured in refill sherry hogsheads before bottling in 2015 as part of Gordon & MacPhail’s “MacPhail’s Collection” range. The nose is earthy, with vanilla, treacle, and dark berries, plus fruit spices. Full-bodied in the mouth, with spicy, zesty plums, raisins, cocktail cherries, and nutmeg. The finish is lengthy, with black treacle, cocoa powder, and an edge of slightly bitter oak.",
"BenRiach Arumaticus 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"The bourbon cask-matured partner to the Sherry Matured bottling (see above), this expression similarly comprises a vatting of whisky distilled in 1973, 1977, 1988, 1991, 2002, and 2006. Both Contrasting Casks are offered in non-chill filtered format. Apple pie, with buttery caramel, milk chocolate, and coconut on the nose. Zesty spices on the early palate, then custard, contrasting lemon, and a note of char. Spicy fruits, black pepper, and more char in the finish. £100",
"BenRiach 16 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"This example of the little-seen Glentauchers immediately shows classic distillery character, which is in the green grassy camp. This verdant aspect continues into fresh fruit salad, with enough ripeness to indicate the time spent in cask. This mix of freshness and weight extends onto the tongue, although the impact fades soon after a light spicy tingle on the back palate. I’d happily have a couple.",
"John McDougall's Selection (distilled at Bladnoch), 15 year old, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,83,110,101 to 500 Dollars,"The mix of honey, citrus, fruit, and malt which sits at Balvenie’s core is beginning to deepen. The citrus fruits, for example, are becoming concentrated, the honey is set clover, the fruits moving into cooked apricot and banana. Rounded and thick in the mouth, where the honeyed aspects and fleshiness of the fruits take control, before a bloom of bridal bouquet. Tremendously complex, here’s Balvenie's flowering into mid-period maturity. The price is…scary! £700",
"Bruichladdich 20 year old (3rd Edition), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,170,101 to 500 Dollars,"Sadly, the final chapter in a series which deservedly acquired cult status because of the way it showed how well Bowmore behaved in close proximity to sherry casks. This was aged in oloroso and PX and has a thick, dark nose, all dried black fruits and saddlebags. The smoke is sotto voce. The savory nature continues on the palate. It needs water to bring out fresh fruits, and while there’s a bitterness on the end, that’s a minor cavil. £190",
"Bruichladdich 20 year old (2nd Edition), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,170,101 to 500 Dollars,"Aberfeldy distillery has added a 16 year old expression to its core range, positioned between the existing 12 and 21 year old variants. This newcomer has been finished in oloroso sherry casks, and the result is a pleasing if undemanding dram with a fresh, sweet, sherried nose, featuring orange, honey, and ginger. Smooth on the palate, with more oranges, marzipan, then milk chocolate and gentle spices. Nutty spice, increasingly bitter orange, and dark chocolate in the finish. £62",
"Blackadder 'Raw Cask' (distilled at Bruichladdich) Cask #841 1986 vintage, 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,83,180,101 to 500 Dollars,"A new, and welcome, permanent member of the core Kilchoman range, this comes from a mix of sherry finished and sherry matured whisky. The nose kicks off with a lovely cigar ash note—a cigar club toward the end of the evening—and while there are some dried fruits from the sherry, Kilchoman’s gentle, light character gives energy and lemony lift—shellfish, grass, and herbs. Lovely balance. Rounded, softly fruity, and highly approachable.",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Caol Ila), cask #00/3454, 15 year old, 1991 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"An immediate and perhaps surprising smokiness which brings to mind cask-aged mezcal (tepeztate to be precise), and it is this green, celery-accented element playing off some oily, nutty, and farmyard notes that gives balance and intrigue. Water reveals its youth, but there’s enough cask action to add some weight to the palate, where the natural sweet spirit shows itself. Keenly priced. Worth a look next time you are flying. (Travel Retail exclusive) £68",
"Signatory 'Un-chillfiltered' (distilled at Clynelish), 13 year old, 1991 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"A new addition to the core range, this shows Glen Grant with a little more weight, but just a little. I’ve never been one for the heavily-sherried versions. Here, the distillery’s signature green elements—spring flowers, fresh apple and pear notes are given a little added weight—apple syrup, toffee, and cooked fruits on the palate. If you’d like an alternative to Glenlivet or Glenfddich 12 then look no further. £43",
"Deanston, 30 year old, 46.7%",Single Malt Scotch,83,265,101 to 500 Dollars,"Some single malts just suit specific cask types. Such is the case with Bunnahabhain and sherry. The spirit has a soft and nutty undertow, plus a gingery note that is given weight and depth by the cask. Amontillado, with its nuttier character, is an ideal bridge between the two. This shows surprising maturity with more oxidized and mulch aromas alongside coffee grounds, and a character that’s drifting into meaty. Brooding, medium-bodied, slightly dry…but the price? Ouch! (Fèis Ìle 2016, 250 bottles) £250",
"Scott's Selection (distilled at Glen Elgin), 1980 Vintage, 44.1%",Single Malt Scotch,83,140,101 to 500 Dollars,"This vatting of three virgin oak casks and one oloroso butt was so keenly priced that it sold out in seconds, all 1,500 bottles of it. It shows Bowmore, that ever-changing, elusive Islay dram in perfumed, scented mode. I picked up vetiver (an integral part of classic male cologne), but also peach, some flamed peels, and plenty of smoke. The palate dips into the sea for a second, then again becomes scented, alongside gentle chocolate. Amazing price too. £55",
"Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glen Grant) 1972 Vintage, 31 year old, 56.1% ABV",Single Malt Scotch,83,155,101 to 500 Dollars,"The eighth edition of heavily-peated Edradour bottled under the Ballechin label is part of the distillery’s Discovery Series and has been aged in Sauternes wine casks. The nose yields sweet, fruity smoke, cocoa, and spice. Sweet and soft on the palate, with more fruity smoke, notably pineapple-influenced, with a hint of smoked fish. The finish is medium to long, with ashy peat and slightly bitter citrus fruits.",
"Hart Brothers (distilled at Glen Grant), 29 year old, 1972 vintage, 53.6%",Single Malt Scotch,83,160,101 to 500 Dollars,"Glenglassaugh distillery launched both unpeated and peated expressions matured in octave casks, approximately one-eighth the capacity of a butt. They have not been subjected to chill-filtration. The nose of this unpeated Classic is sweet, with ripe apples, peaches, toffee, and buttery spice. Smooth on the palate, with more peaches and now intense spiciness, followed by vanilla, aniseed, licorice, new oak, and mild cloves in the long, slightly citric finish. £55",
"Murray McDavid Mission IV (distilled at Glendronach) 1974 Vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,210,101 to 500 Dollars,"Distilled in 1994 and matured in a single hogshead, this 21 year old expression is part of Wemyss Malts’ 2016 Midsummer Single Cask Release. Rich, stewed fruits, honey, and allspice on the pleasing nose. Voluptuous on the palate with spicy apple and cranberry. The finish dries quite rapidly to aniseed and spicy oak. (220 bottles) £100",
"The Singleton of Glendullan, 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,36,0 to 100 Dollars,"This peated expression from Tobermory distillery has been aged in refill, remade hogsheads. The nose offers earthy peat, citrus fruit, vanilla, and smoked haddock in butter. Big, sweet peat notes on the peppery palate, with marshmallows and lively spices. The spices linger to the close, with peat embers and a hint of brine on the lips. £60",
"Glenglassaugh, 44 year old, 1960 vintage, 41.7%",Single Malt Scotch,83,900,501 to 1000 Dollars,"This peated expression was matured in quarter casks and is the first bottling to be launched since BenRiach was acquired by Brown-Forman in April 2016. The nose offers sweet peat and new leather, coal, and a hint of iodine. White pepper and big peat notes on the palate. Ripe apples develop and spices spread around the mouth. The finish is medium in length, warming, and gently smoky. £65",
"The Dalmore 35 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,92,5000,1001 to 5000 Dollars,"Marginally less aggressive than in 2014, this Big Peat is more rounded and exhibits greater finesse. Overall, it’s a better whisky. The invasive smoke still infiltrates the skull and clasps your brain tightly. A sweet smoke of smoldering hillside wildfire extinguished by rubber beaters, balanced by meadow flowers, tree blossom, and honey. Sticky lemons smeared in thick honey, cracked black pepper, and a fabulous, almost gelatinous texture, it builds solidly in peaty intensity. Knockout! A hot, smoky finish like dragon’s breath.",
"Highland Park 31 year old 1974 vintage (Cask #8998), 45.4%",Single Malt Scotch,83,440,101 to 500 Dollars,"One of the duo of releases in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series, ‘IPA’ was finished for 3 months in casks that previously held the Speyside Craft Brewery’s India pale ale. The nose offers hops and honey, malt, toffee, cooking apples, and lemon. Smooth on the palate, with more honey and toffee, soft spices and, ultimately, slightly bitter, hoppy ale notes. The finish is medium in length, with dry spices and plain chocolate.",
"Signatory 7 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 1999 vintage, 58.0%",Single Malt Scotch,83,45,0 to 100 Dollars,"Initially aged in bourbon barrels, this expression was transferred into Cabernet Sauvignon wine casks in March 2011 for additional maturation. Musty wine notes on the early nose soon become red berries and vanilla. Supple on the palate, with big red berry notes, plus honey and ginger. Lingering ginger and raspberries in the finish, drying to dark chocolate (2,520 bottles) £70",
"Duncan Taylor 'Rarest of the Rare' (distilled at Linlithgow), Cask #2214, 21 year old, 1982 vintage, 63.5%",Single Malt Scotch,83,220,101 to 500 Dollars,"This 9 year old bottling has been fully matured in Caribbean rum barrels. Quite delicate on the nose, with wet grass, then emerging coconut and whipped cream. Slick on the palate, with an instant tropical fruit hit—ripe banana and pineapple—plus more cream, cinnamon, and hazelnut. Spicy and nutty in the finish, with a final tropical fruit tang (6,600 bottles) £40",
"Murray McDavid (distilled at Lochside) 1981, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,76,0 to 100 Dollars,"This single cask bottling from Langside Distillers was aged in a sherry butt and bottled in 2015. Candied orange peel on the early nose, soft sweet sherry, and glacé cherries. Fragrant, with milk chocolate-coated Turkish Delight. Sweet, spicy sherry, plus pepper and cinnamon on the uncomplicated palate. Fruity spices in the medium-length finish. (222 bottles, Robertsons of Pitlochry exclusive) £45",
"Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Longmorn), 15 year old, 1989 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,65,0 to 100 Dollars,"The second release in the Custodians’ series was matured in two sherry hogsheads—one first-fill and the other second-fill. This 46 year old is presented at cask strength. The early nose offers herbal and menthol notes, old resin, citrus fruits, then milk chocolate-coated peppermint creams… idiosyncratic. The palate is quite thin, with more citrus fruits, almonds, and developing wood notes. The finish is lightly oaky and mouth-drying, with a touch of black pepper.",
"Signatory 14 year old 1990 vintage (distilled at Macallan, Cask #16294), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Matured in bourbon casks, this is the second release from the fledgling Caithness Distillery. Clearly youthful on the nose, but not raw, with ginger, melon, and background resin. Ultimately, mildly floral. Chili notes on the relatively dry palate, with nutmeg and spicy oak. The finish is on the short side of medium in length, peppery, and slightly bitter. Once decanted, this dram improves significantly and is rated on that basis. (1,200 bottles)£65",
"The Macallan 10 year old Fine Oak, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,44,0 to 100 Dollars,"A solid presence in the range, the strength and malt content continue to mark these out over their contemporaries. Grapefruit peels, sliced juicy orange, and lemon butter icing on the nose. The palate is thinner than others in the range, with crystallized orange, fudge, plus cardamom and mild pepper. The finish of sugared satsumas is boosted by a long lasting trail of spices.",
"Whisky Galore (distilled at Old Pulteney) 16 year old 1989 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"Benachie, formerly known as Jericho, was an Aberdeenshire distillery built southeast of Huntly that existed from 1822–1913. A dark amber dram with a nose of marmalade, ground almond, cherry lips, and vanilla essence. Attractive, but not overly aromatic. Cooked plums after a peppery rush begin an attenuated flavor journey, exiting with a spicy finale.",
"Tullibardine, 1993 Vintage, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"It will soon be 120 years since this workhorse of a distillery came into being. Golden Grahams, sanded oak, whole lemon, floral blooms, and cumin seeds on the nose, but the whole confection is rather restrained. The palate is sweet, but could be too sweet for some; Scottish tablet, caramel, ripe banana, granulated sugar, and ginger loaf. Some late heat accompanies the sugary finish. Remember to brush your teeth before bed.",
"Bruichladdich 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,50,0 to 100 Dollars,"With whiskies aged for 5 years in bourbon barrels, this has a pleasant nose of dark toffee, vanilla, toasted whole grain bread, and light spices. The mouthfeel is a bit flabby; chocolate and toasted spices, especially cinnamon and pepper, are quelled by malty caramel, baked orange, and touches of old leather. The finish is dry, malty, and slightly nutty, with a hollow core of spices. A bit dour overall.",
"Longrow C.V., 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,75,0 to 100 Dollars,"This blend has been a Whyte and MacKay whisky for 25 years. The nose has spice, toffee, wheat biscuits, and smoke, but the combination feels a little benign. The palate is jammy, lightweight, and middle-of-the-road. With a backbone of grain, there are flavors of graham cracker, chocolate ganache, well-baked fruitcake, banoffee pie, smoke, and dried peels, with a burst of spices on the finish.",
"Bruichladdich Links Torrey Pine 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,85,0 to 100 Dollars,"How does this long-established blend shape up on its own without a ginger or soda mixer? Fresh apple juice, a twist of lemon, dried orange peel, peppercorn, cracker bread, and a vegetal spicy note. It gets into its stride with delicious apple, gentle fudge, and good-tempered spices, with cracked black pepper and a little sourness to finish. Mild, agreeably smooth, without any bombast or hullabaloo; it just blends in.",
"Bowmore 16 year old 1992 vintage Wine Cask-Matured, 53.5%",Single Malt Scotch,83,120,101 to 500 Dollars,"If you aren’t expecting it, the herbaceous, grassy, mineral aromas are a surprise, more expected in an agave spirit than a typical Speysider. But there’s something entrancing about the herbal flavors of tarragon, licorice tea, chestnut honey, and saline, which resolve into a lightly sweet, slightly spiced finish. This is unusual, but beguiling. (Trader Joe’s)",
"The Balvenie Signature 12 year old Batch #1, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,83,55,0 to 100 Dollars,"Earthy, with corn husk and biscuit dough on the nose, along with cooked apples, white pepper, and a light spice. Honey, almond meal, toasted marshmallow, and a hint of lemon make for a simple, somewhat grainy palate. It finishes short and sweet, with some cinnamon heat. (Costco)",
"The Antiquary, 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,83,30,0 to 100 Dollars,"The nose is grassy and light, with some youthful heat, orange blossom, vanilla, coconut, and cedar. A clean palate of lemon, orange, vanilla, banana, and toasted coconut leads into a simple finish of oak and more vanilla. Basic, but well balanced. (Total Wine & More)",
"Eades Highland 'Double Malt', 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,70,0 to 100 Dollars,"The nose is pleasant, with fresh strawberry, spicy smoke, cookie dough, allspice, and glacé cherry, but the palate fails to shine or excite. This has been finished in port and Pedro Ximénez casks, giving the whisky a subtle rose hue, but it needs more body. There are flavors of biscuit, mandarin, vanilla, and redcurrant. It meanders along with a fairly flat trajectory, then hits the buffers with some lingering rosehip fruitiness. (2,266 bottles for U.S.)",
"BenRiach Sauternes Wood Finish 16 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,113,101 to 500 Dollars,"Pleasingly aromatic and floral, with lively fruit, fresh cereal grain, honey and vanilla cream. Subtle grassy, hay notes add complexity. A very friendly whisky, conjuring up images of a sunny afternoon in Spring. 
",
The Macallan Whisky Maker,Single Malt Scotch,83,90,0 to 100 Dollars,"A blend of three different single malts. Its name derives from the fact that the whisky is aged in American oak bodies with French Oak heads (a cross of both oaks). There’s no age statement, but the whiskies are all older than ten years. This is a gentle, subtly complex, somewhat lithe, easy drinking whisky (and with less oak spice than its predecessor, The Spice Tree). People think whisky is an after-dinner drink, but I think this would make a great aperitif because of its delicate dry spice notes and light body. I’m picking up evenly-proportioned notes of vanilla and coconut, with more subtle notes of clove, anise, and delicate fruit, all wrapped up in a gentle, malty body. A very versatile whisky. 
",
"Arran St. Emilion Wine Cask Finish (Limited Edition), 50%",Single Malt Scotch,83,80,0 to 100 Dollars,"A very textural whisky. Incredibly creamy, with mouth-coating vanilla, honeyed barley, hay, linseed oil, clementine, and subtle peach. The whisky continues to cling to the palate long after the finish. It’s what you would expect Auchentoshan to taste like, but bolder. A nice whisky, but lacking the polish of the standard 21 year old expression.",
"Smoking Ember, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,40,0 to 100 Dollars,"The tell-tale rich honeyed Balvenie personality is spiced up by finishing it off in new charred oak casks, making a normally masculine whisky even bigger. The honeyed malt impacts the palate first, with intermediate notes of citrus fruit, followed by dried spices (cinnamon, vanilla, ginger, and cocoa). The new oak impact is most evident on the whisky’s long, dry, spicy finish. A nice whisky, but perhaps a tad too much new oak for greatness?",
"Teaninich, 1996 vintage, 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,83,325,101 to 500 Dollars,"Very fruity and spicy. High, bright fruit notes of lemon, mandarin, and mango, with a sprinkling of ginger and powdered vanilla. Oak kicks in on the end, leading to a fairly dry finish, which is not surprising for a 30 year old whisky. 
",
